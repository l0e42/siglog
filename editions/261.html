It exposes participants to cutting-edge research and can open up new research avenues and collaboration opportunities. The Logic Mentoring Workshop introduces young researchers to the technical and practical aspects of a career in logic research. It is targeted at students, from senior undergraduates to doctoral students, and will include tutorials and plenary talks as well as a panel discussion, where experienced researchers from the field answer career-related questions from the audience.<br/></li><li> The workshop will be an on-site event, co-located with the Logic in Computer Science conference (LICS’25, <a href="https://lics.siglog.org/">https://lics.siglog.org/</a>) one of the most prestigious conferences on the topic. <br/></li><li> REGISTRATION and PROGRAM<br/>  Registration is set up through the LICS website. The cost of the workshop is included in the registration for LICS, and separately costs 80 SGD.

We have all been there. You might not feel comfortable if you don't know anyone. Join our Buddy Program, and we will help you to get in touch with another mentoring workshop attendee. Every newcomer will be assigned either a more experienced peer or another newcomer, so you are not alone. For those who are not attending a conference for the first time, being a buddy is a way for you to help the community to grow and introduce less experienced students to the field.

The symposium covers an ample spectrum of themes, ranging from theory to applications, and encourages cross-fertilization. Papers focused on formal methods are especially welcome. Authors are invited to submit original research or tool papers on all relevant topics in these areas. Papers discussing new ideas that are at an early stage of development are also welcome.</p><p class="meta">  For a full list of topics please visit our website.</p><ul><li> Proceedings:<br/>  The proceedings will be published by Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science.

Topics of interest for EXPRESS/SOS 2025 include, but are not limited to:<br/><ul><li> expressiveness and rigorous comparisons between models of computation (process algebras, event structures, Petri nets, rewrite systems) </li><li> expressiveness and rigorous comparisons between programming languages and models (distributed, component-based, object-oriented, service-oriented); </li><li> logics for concurrency (modal logics, probabilistic and stochastic logics, temporal logics and resource logics); </li><li> analysis techniques for concurrent systems; </li><li> theory of structural operational semantics (meta-theory, category-theoretic approaches, congruence results); </li><li> comparisons between structural operational semantics and other formal semantic approaches; </li><li> applications and case studies of structural operational semantics; </li><li> software tools that automate, or are based on, structural operational semantics. </li></ul></li><li> We especially welcome contributions bridging the gap between the above topics and neighboring areas, such as, for instance:<br/><ul><li> computer security  </li><li> multi-agent systems </li><li> programming languages </li><li> formal verification </li><li> reversible computation </li><li> knowledge representation </li></ul></li><li> SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:<br/>  We invite two types of submissions:<br/><ul><li> Full papers (up to 15 pages, excluding references). </li><li> Short papers (up to 5 pages, excluding references, not included in the workshop post-proceedings) </li></ul>  All submissions have to adhere to the EPTCS format (<a href="https://info.eptcs.org/">https://info.eptcs.org/</a>). Simultaneous submission to journals, conferences or other workshops is only allowed for short papers; full papers must be unpublished. Submission is performed through EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=expresssos2024">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=expresssos2024</a> The final versions of accepted full papers will be published in EPTCS. It is understood that for each accepted submission one of the co-authors will register for the workshop and present the paper. We are pleased to announce the possibility of a Joint Special Issue with EXPRESS/SOS 2025 (due in December 2024).<br/></li><li> WORKSHOP CO-CHAIRS:<br/><ul><li> Cinzia Di Giusto (Université de Nice Sophia-Antipolis, France) </li><li> Giorgio Bacci (Aalborg University, Denmark) </li></ul></li><li> CONTACT<br/>  Prospective authors are encouraged to contact the co-chairs in case of questions at cinzia.di-giusto@univ-cotedazur.fr grbacci@cs.aau.dk<br/></li></ul><h2><a id="PODS2026" name="PODS2026" ></a>PODS 2026: ACM SIGMOD-SIGACT-SIGART SYMPOSIUM ON PRINCIPLES OF DATABASE SYSTEMS</h2><p class="meta">  May 31 - June 05, 2026, Bengaluru, India</p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://2026.sigmod.org/index.shtml">https://2026.sigmod.org/index.shtml</a></p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> The PODS symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundation on database systems.

TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.<br/>  Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration. The verification of systems based on machine learning spurs novel combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g., property verification of surrogate models that are generated through testing.<br/>  TAP's scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology, including foundational work, tool development, and empirical research. Topics of interest center around the combination of static techniques such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.<br/></li><li> SUBMISSION GUIDELINES<br/>  We solicit various categories of papers:<br/><ul><li> Regular Papers (max 15 pages) </li><li> Regular Papers, submitted to the TAP track (max 15 pages) </li><li> Long tool papers (max 15 pages) </li><li> Case study papers (max 15 pages) </li><li> Short papers (max 6 pages), including tool demonstration papers </li></ul>  All page limits do not include references and appendices.
