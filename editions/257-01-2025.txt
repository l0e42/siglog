LMW@CSL 2025: Logic Mentoring Workshop co-located with CSL 2025
  Amsterdam, Netherlands
  Monday 10th February 2025
  https://logic-mentoring-workshop.github.io/csl25/
  Co-located with CSL 2025
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION - s SIGLOG MATTER
  The 12th Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW@CSL) invites participation from students (undergraduate, master's and PhD), in all areas of logic for scholarships to attend the CSL (Computer Science Logic) conference and the LMW (Logic Mentoring Workshop) this year. Attending a conference such as CSL can be a transformative experience. It exposes participants to cutting-edge research and can open up new research avenues and collaboration opportunities. Some scholarships will be generously funded by our sponsors (see below) and cover registration to the workshop, and possibly travel and accommodation. Thanks to generous funding of the NSF, we will additionally be able to fund several US-based students to attend the entire conference. Women and members of minority groups are especially encouraged to apply.
  The LMW will focus on the technical and practical aspects of a career in logic research, including talks and a panel session from leaders in the subject. LMW'25 builds on a long tradition of LMW workshops held at LICS and CSL every year.
* WORKSHOP REGISTRATION
  Registration costs €50 and is done via the CSL main conference webpage: https://csl2025.github.io/index#registration. Registration to the CSL2025 main conference includes registration for the workshop, if you do so please indicate that you are attending the LMW workshop as well. 
 -dh Early bird registration: Jan 10 2025.
* SPEAKERS : TBA
  Following the tradition, the Logic Mentoring Workshop will invite senior and junior researchers to share their experience on soft skills and career management after a PhD in Logic, as well as to give scientific talks.

ICGT 2025: International Conference on Graph Transformations 2025
  https://conf.researchr.org/home/icgt-2025
CALL FOR PAPERS 
* Important dates: 
 -dh Abstracts deadline: 28 Jan 2025 (AoE)
 -dh Submission deadline: 4 Feb 2025 (AoE)
 -dh Journal-First Submission:  22 Apr 2025 (AoE)
 -dv Conference: June 10-13, 2025
* The 18th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2025) will be held in Koblenz, Germany, as part of STAF 2025 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place under the auspices of EASST, EATCS, and IFIP WG 1.3. 
* Aims and Scope
  The use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer science as well as in many fields of computational research and engineering. Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights.
  ICGT aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas.
* Research Papers
  In order to foster a lively exchange of perspectives on the subject of the conference, the programme committee of ICGT 2025 encourages all kinds of contributions related to graphs and graph transformation, either from a theoretical point of view or a practical one. For details on submission types, instructions, proceedings, and special issue, please visit the conference website.

* TOPICS OF INTEREST
  Blockchain is a novel technology to store data in a decentralized way. Although the technology was originally invented to enable cryptocurrencies, it quickly found applications in several other domains. Blockchains may also provide support for Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are scripts of an ad-hoc programming language that are stored in the blockchain and that run on the network. They can interact with the ledger’s data and update its state. These scripts can express the logic of possibly complex contracts between users of the blockchain. Thus, Smart Contracts can facilitate the economic activity of blockchain participants.
  Since blockchains are often used to store financial transactions, bugs may result in huge economic losses and thus it is now of utmost importance to have strong guarantees of the behaviour of blockchain software. These guarantees can be brought by using Formal Methods. Indeed, Blockchain software encompasses many topics of computer science where using Formal Methods techniques and tools is relevant: consensus algorithms to ensure the liveness and the security of the data on the chain, programming languages specifically designed to write smart contracts, cryptographic protocols, such as zero-knowledge proofs, used to ensure privacy, etc. This workshop is a forum to identify theoretical and practical approaches of formal methods for Blockchain technology.
  Topics include, but are not limited to:
 - Formal models of Blockchain applications or concepts
 - Formal methods for consensus protocols
 - Formal methods for Blockchain-specific cryptographic primitives or protocols
 - Design and implementation of Smart Contract languages
 - Verification of Smart Contracts
 - Zero-knowledge proof and its applications in a blockchain setting
* SUBMISSION
  Submit original manuscripts (not published or considered elsewhere) with a page limit of 12 pages for full papers and 6 pages for short and tool papers (excluding bibliography and short appendix of up to 5 additional pages). Alternatively you may also submit an extended abstract of up to 3 pages (including bibliography) summarizing your ongoing work in the area of formal methods and blockchain. Authors of selected extended-abstracts are invited to give a short lightning talk. Extended abstracts will not occur in the workshop proceedings. Submission link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmbc2025 . Authors are encouraged to use LaTeX and prepare their submissions according to the instructions and styling guides for OASIcs provided by Dagstuhl.
  Instructions for authors: https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors#oasics . At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the workshop as a registered participant.
* PROCEEDINGS 
  All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the program committee for quality and relevance. Accepted regular papers (full, short, and tool papers) will be included in the workshop proceeding, which will be published as a volume of the OpenAccess Series in Informatics (OASIcs) by Dagstuhl.
