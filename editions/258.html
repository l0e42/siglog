Submission server Track B: <a href="https://icalp25-b.hotcrp.com">https://icalp25-b.hotcrp.com</a><br/><ul><li>  Papers must present original research on the theory of computer science. No prior publication and no simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed. Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an on-line repository such as ArXiv, HAL, ECCC. </li><li> Submissions take the form of an extended abstract of no more than 15 pages, excluding references and a clearly labelled appendix. The appendix may consist either of omitted proofs or of a full version of the submission, and it will be read at the discretion of program committee members. The use of the LIPIcs document class is an option, but not required. The extended abstract has to present the merits of the paper and its main contributions clearly, and describe the key concepts and technical ideas used to obtain the results. Submissions must provide the proofs which can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be verified. </li><li>  Submissions are anonymous. The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. </li><li> Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed. </li><li> The submissions are done via HotCRP to the appropriate track of the conference. The use of pdflatex or similar pdf generating tools is mandatory and the page limit is strict (see point 2.) Papers that deviate significantly from these requirements risk rejection without consideration of merit. </li><li> During the rebuttal phase, authors will have from March 21-24, 2025 the opportunity to view and respond to initial reviews. Further instructions will be sent to authors of submitted papers before that time. </li><li> At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register for the conference, and all talks are in-person. In exceptional cases, there may be support for remotely presenting a talk. </li><li> Papers authored only by students should be marked as such upon submission in order to be eligible for the best student paper awards of the track. </li></ul></li><li> PROCEEDINGS <br/>  ICALP proceedings are published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series. This is a series of high-quality conference proceedings across all fields in informatics established in cooperation with Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz Center for Informatics. LIPIcs volumes are published according to the principle of Open Access, i.e., they are available online and free of charge. The accepted papers will need to comply with the LIPIcs style.<br/></li></ul><h2><a id="ICLP2025" name="ICLP2025" ></a>ICLP 2025: 41st International Conference on Logic Programming </h2><p class="meta">  University of Calabria, Rende, Italy | September 12-19, 2025</p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/">https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/</a></p>CALL FOR PAPERS <ul><li> SCOPE<br/>  Since the first conference In Marseille in 1982, ICLP has been the premier international event for presenting research in logic programming.

This school, the fourteenth in the series, focuses on the principles and practice of formal techniques, with a strong emphasis on the hands-on use and development of this technology. It primarily targets graduate students and young researchers who are interested in studying and using formal techniques in their research. A prior background in formal methods is helpful but not required. Participants at the school can expect to have a seriously fun time experimenting with the tools and techniques presented in the lectures during the laboratory sessions. The main lectures run from Monday May 26 to Fri May 30. They are preceded by a background course "Speaking Logic" on May 24/25.<br/></li><li> The lecturers at  the school include:<br/><ul><li> Joost-Pieter Katoen (RWTH Aachen): Deductive Verification of Probabilistic Programs with Caesar </li><li> Erika Abraham (RWTH Aachen): Understanding and using SAT and SMT solvers </li><li> Kristin Yvonne Rozier (Iowa State): Runtime Verification with R2U2 </li><li> Philippa Gardner (Imperial): Compositional Verification using the Gillian Platform </li><li> Nate Foster (Cornell University): Programming and Reasoning with Kleene Algebra with Tests </li></ul>  The program also features invited talks from distinguished speakers (to be announced) and the background "Speaking Logic" course taught by Natarajan Shankar (SRI) and Stephane Graham-Lengrand (SRI).<br/></li><li> The 2025 Summer School on Formal Techniques will take place in a hybrid mode: the lectures and labs will be live-streamed and recorded. We strongly encourage in-person participation so that you can benefit from interactions outside the classroom. We have funding from NSF to cover transportation/food/lodging expenses for selected US-based students. Non-student and non-US in-person participants are expected to cover their own transportation and will be charged a fee (around $150/day) to cover the cost of food and lodging. The registration link is at the URL: <a href="https://SSFT-SRI.github.io">https://SSFT-SRI.github.io</a>.<br/>  Applicants are urged to submit their applications as early as possible (no later than March 31, 2025), since there are only a limited number of spaces available. Those needing invitation letters for visa purposes should complete their applications as early as possible.  We strongly encourage the participation of women and under-represented minorities in the summer school.<br/>Registration of applications: Mar 31, 2025<br></li></ul><br><br><br>Links: <a href="http://siglog.org/">SIGLOG website</a>, <a href="https://lics.siglog.org">LICS website</a>, <a href="https://lics.siglog.org/newsletters/">SIGLOG Monthly</a>.</div></body></html>
