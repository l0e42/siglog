For smaller SIGs like ours, the minimum overhead increased from USD 10,000 to USD 25,000 annually. This change has significantly impacted SIGLOG's finances, and if we cannot find a way to pay the fee, we will be obliged to either merge SIGLOG with another SIG (the best choice, probably, would be SIGPLAN) or de-charter it altogether. <br/></li><li> We requested additional time from ACM to explore ways of securing the financial foundation necessary to keep SIGLOG independent. We explained that our plan includes to seek increased industry sponsorship, grow our membership, and conduct fundraising activities at LICS and other events. ACM responded positively, SIGLOG now has until July 31, 2025, to develop a concrete, viable financial plan.<br/></li><li> As a first step, we would like to ask you for support. This is not only a financial matter: to ensure our strength as a committed SIG, we need to increase our membership numbers. While the LICS community comprises around 2,600 people, SIGLOG currently has only about 200 members. We strongly encourage all LICS members to join SIGLOG. The membership fee is very affordable -- just 25 USD, a rate that has remained unchanged since the start of SIGLOG. We plan to maintain this rate, at least for students and early-career researchers, to support inclusivity.<br/></li><li> Another goal is to promote industry sponsorship. Many in our community have strong connections with industry partners, and securing initial sponsorship would provide vital support as we work toward more stable, long-term financial solutions. If you have connections who might be interested in supporting SIGLOG, now is the time to reach out and explore potential sponsorship opportunities.<br/></li><li> Finally, we invite your engagement, ideas, and shared experiences to help us build a sustainable future for SIGLOG. Your support is essential in ensuring that SIGLOG continues to exist as an independent entity dedicated to Logic.<br/></li><li> Thank you very much for your time and consideration. <br/></li><li> P.s. The SIGLOG web page is here: <a href="https://siglog.org/">https://siglog.org/</a>, and the instructions to join SIGLOG are here:  <a href="https://siglog.org/membership/">https://siglog.org/membership/</a>. Note that you don't need to have a separate ACM membership in order to subscribe to SIGLOG.<br/></li><li> Best regards, Catuscia Palamidessi SIGLOG's chair, Also on behalf of the SIGLOG EC. <br/></li></ul><h2><a id="DisCoTec2025" name="DisCoTec2025" ></a>DisCoTec 2025: 20th International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques</h2><p class="meta">  Lille, France, 16-20 June 2025</p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://www.discotec.org/2025">https://www.discotec.org/2025</a></p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> DisCoTec 2025 is one of the major events sponsored by the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and the European Association for Programming Languages and Systems (EAPLS).

The symposium specifically focuses on concurrent software but does not exclude the analysis of sequential software. Submissions are solicited on theoretical results, novel algorithms, tool development, and empirical evaluation. <br/></li><li> The SPIN symposium originated as a workshop focusing on explicit state model checking, specifically as related to the SPIN model checker. However, over the years it has evolved to a broadly-scoped symposium for software analysis using any automated techniques, including model checking, automated theorem proving, and symbolic execution. An overview of the previous SPIN symposia (and early workshops) can be found at: <a href="https://spinroot.com/spin/Workshops/">https://spinroot.com/spin/Workshops/</a>.<br/></li><li> A full list of the topics of interest can be found at <a href="https://spin-web.github.io/SPIN2025/cfp">https://spin-web.github.io/SPIN2025/cfp</a> together with submission instructions and details. <br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES: <br/><table><tr><td>Paper Submission: </td><td>Feb 13, 2025</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Artifact Submission (Tool Papers): </td><td>Feb 27, 2025</td> </tr><tr><td>Paper/Artifact Notifications: </td><td>Mar 24, 2025</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Artifact Submission (Other Papers): </td><td>Mar 12, 2025</td> </tr><tr><td>Non-tool Paper Artifact Notification: </td><td>May 01, 2025</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Symposium: </td><td>May 7-8, 2025</td> </tr></table></li><li> ARTIFACT EVALUATION:<br/>  SPIN 2025 will feature artifact evaluation, performed by an Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC). The AEC evaluates artifacts based on documentation, availability, reproducibility of results, and tool reusability (if applicable). Artifact submission is mandatory for Full Tool Papers. While artifact submission is optional for papers in other categories, we highly encourage authors of papers involving tool development and empirical evaluation to submit an artifact for evaluation. Papers with an accompanying artifact may be awarded one or more badges from the EAPLS artifact badging scheme (<a href="https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/">https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/</a>).

The conference will be preceded by the Adjoint School on May 26-30, 2025. This conference follows previous events at Oxford (2024, 2019), University of Maryland (2023), Strathclyde (2022), Cambridge (2021), MIT (2020), and Leiden (2019). <br/>  Applied category theory is important to a growing community of researchers who study computer science, logic, engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, social science, systems, linguistics and other subjects using category-theoretic tools. The background and experience of our members is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the Applied Category Theory conference series is to bring researchers together, strengthen the applied category theory community, disseminate the latest results, and facilitate further development of the field.<br/></li><li>IMPORTANT DATES <br/>  All deadlines are AoE (Anywhere on Earth).<br/><table><tr><td>Abstract submission: </td><td>Feb 26, 2025</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Paper submission: </td><td>Mar 03, 2025</td> </tr><tr><td>Notifiaction: </td><td>Apr 07, 2025</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Final versions: </td><td>May 19, 2025</td> </tr><tr><td>Conference: </td><td>June 2-6, 2025</td> </tr></table></li><li> SUBMISSIONS<br/>  The submission URL is: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=act2025">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=act2025</a> . We accept submissions in English of original research papers, talks about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere, and demonstrations of relevant software. Accepted original research papers will be published in a proceedings volume. The conference will include an industry showcase event and community meeting. We particularly encourage people from underrepresented groups to submit their work and the organizers are committed to non-discrimination, equity, and inclusion.<br/>  Conference Papers should present original, high-quality work in the style of a computer science conference paper (up to 12 pages, not counting the bibliography; more detailed parts of proofs may be included in an appendix for the convenience of the reviewers). Such submissions should not be an abridged version of an existing journal article although pre-submission arXiv preprints are permitted. These submissions will be adjudicated for both a talk and publication in the conference proceedings.<br/>  Talk proposals not to be published in the proceedings, e.g. about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere, should be submitted as abstracts, one or two pages long. Authors are encouraged to include links to any full versions of their papers, preprints or manuscripts. The purpose of the abstract is to provide a basis for determining the topics and quality of the anticipated presentation.<br/>  Software demonstration proposals should also be submitted as abstracts, one or two pages. The purpose of the abstract is to provide the program committee with enough information to assess the content of the demonstration.<br/></li><li> The selected conference papers will be published in a volume of Proceedings. Authors are advised to use EPTCS style; files are available at style.eptcs.org.
