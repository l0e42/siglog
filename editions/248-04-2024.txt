LearnAut 2024: Learning and Automata
  Tallinn University, Tallinn, Estonia, July 7th
  ICALP 2024 workshop
  Website: https://learnaut24.github.io/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* ABOUT 
  Learning models defining recursive computations, like automata and formal grammars, are the core of the field called Grammatical Inference (GI). The expressive power of these models and the complexity of the associated computational problems are major research topics within mathematical logic and computer science. Historically, there has been little interaction between the GI and ICALP communities, though recently some important results started to bridge the gap between both worlds, including applications of learning to formal verification and model checking, and (co-)algebraic formulations of automata and grammar learning algorithms.
* The aim of this workshop is to bring together experts on logic who could benefit from grammatical inference tools, and researchers in grammatical inference who could find in logic and verification new fruitful applications for their methods.
* We invite submissions of recent work, including preliminary research, related to the theme of the workshop. The Program Committee will select a subset of the abstracts for oral presentation. At least one author of each accepted abstract is expected to represent it at the workshop.
* SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS & TOPICS
  For topics and submission instructions see: https://learnaut24.github.io/calls.html . 
  Note that accepted papers will be made available on the workshop website but will not be part of formal proceedings (i.e., LearnAut is a non-archival workshop). We do accept submissions of work recently published, currently under review or work-in-progress.

   University of Kent
JOB ANNOUNCEMENT
 * We seek a talented and motivated postdoc/Research associate to join the School of Computing at the University of Kent, Canterbury, UK. The Research Associate will participate in cutting edge research on type-based enforcement and compilation techniques for enforcement of security properties of higher-order programs. The position is on an EPSRC funded project titled "TYPDSEC: Type-based information declassification and its secure compilation". The post is based in Canterbury and will be directly supervised by Dr. Vineet Rajani (https://vineetrajani.github.io/).
* The project will be in the intersection of modal type theory, information flow control and secure compilation. It will also involve mechanisation in the HOL4 theorem prover and implementation in the CakeML ecosystem. Applicants should have a strong background in formal methods evidenced by high-quality research publications or artifacts in top-tier venues of programming languages, formal verification or security research. The project will involve close collaboration with Prof. Magnus Myreen (Chalmers).
* As a Research Associate you will:
  - build novel type theories, proof techniques and compilation methods to reason about hyperproperties relevant for security of higher-order programs.
  - work on mechanisation of the above in HOL4.
  - integrate them in the CakeML framework, a real world compiler for the ML like language.
*To be successful in this role you must:
  - have a PhD or equivalent experience in Computing or in a related discipline.
  - have a track record of peer-reviewed publications at scientific workshops, conferences or journals.
  - have excellent mathematical skills relevant for analysis of computer programs.
* The university of Kent is walking distance from the charming city of Canterbury. It has a high speed connection to London, and travel to Europe is convenient by rail or car. Please apply through any of the following URLs:
