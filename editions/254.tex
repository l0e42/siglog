CALL FOR wORKSHOPS 

\begin{itemize}\item  We invite proposals for workshops on topics of interest to the LICS conference. Typically, LICS workshops feature a number of invited speakers and a number of contributed presentations. LICS workshops do not usually produce formal proceedings. However, in the past there have been special issues of journals based in part on certain LICS workshops. The conference will provide a room, internet connection and help with some local organization. The workshops selection committee consists of the LICS Workshops Chair (Valentin Blot), the LICS General Chair, the LICS PC Chairs and the LICS Conference Chairs. 
 
\item  IMPORTANT DATES FOR WORKSHOPS:

\item  Proposals must be limited to three pages, should be submitted to lics25-workshops at valentinblot.org and should include: 
 
\begin{itemize}\item  Workshop's name and URL if already available or from previous years
\item  A short scientific summary and justification of the proposed topic; this should include a discussion of the particular benefits of the topic to the LICS community
\item  A list of workshop organizers with contact information
\item  Potential invited speakers (how many you would expect and, if possible, tentative names)
\item  Procedures for selecting presentations (if you plan a call for contributed talks or papers followed by a selection procedure, the submission date should be scheduled after the conference's notification date - Apr 8, 2025 - and the notification should take place before the early registration deadline - late April / early May)
\item  Plans for dissemination, if any (e.g. proceeding, journal special issue, etc.)
\item  Proposed format and agenda (e.g. paper presentations, tutorials, demo sessions)
\item  The proposed duration (e.g. 1/2, 1, 2 day(s))
\item  Expected number of participants, providing some data on previous years, if the workshop has already been organised in the past.

JOB ANNOUNCEMENT 

\begin{itemize}\item  The recently established Cluster of Excellence CoE Bilateral Artificial Intelligence (BILAI), funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), is are looking for more than 50 PhD students and 10 Post-Doc researchers (m/f/d) to join their team at one of the six leading research institutions across Austria (see below). 
 
\item  In BILAI, major Austrian players in Artificial Intelligence (AI) are teaming up to work towards Broad AI. As opposed to Narrow AI, which is characterized by task-specific skills, Broad AI seeks to address a wide array of problems, rather than being limited to a single task or domain. To develop its foundations, BILAI employs a Bilateral AI approach, effectively combining sub-symbolic AI (neural networks and machine learning) with symbolic AI (logic, knowledge representation, and reasoning) in various ways. Harnessing the full potential of both symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches can open new avenues for AI, enhancing its ability to solve novel problems, adapt to diverse environments, improve reasoning skills, and increase efficiency in computation and data use. These key features enable a broad range of applications for Broad AI, from drug development and medicine to planning and scheduling, autonomous traffic management, and recommendation systems. Prioritizing fairness, transparency, and explainability, the development of Broad AI is crucial for addressing ethical concerns and ensuring a positive impact on society. 
 
\item  The research team is committed to cross-disciplinary work in order to provide theory and models for future AI and deployment to applications. 
 
\item  CoE Research Institutions: 
 
\begin{itemize}\item  Johannes Kepler UniversitÃ¤t Linz (JKU Linz)
\item  Technische UniversitÃ¤t Wien (TU Wien)
\item  Alpen-Adria-UniversitÃ¤t Klagenfurt (AAU)
\item  Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA)
\item  Technische UniversitÃ¤t Graz (TU Graz)
\item  WirtschaftsuniversitÃ¤t Wien (WU Wien)
\end{itemize} 
\item  The call for applications is available at \href{https://www.bilateral-ai.net/jobs/}{https://www.bilateral-ai.net/jobs/}.
