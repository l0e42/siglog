The extension of the lambda-calculus with a derivation operator gives a syntactic account of differentiation, which reconciles the computational, logical, and algebraic notions of linearity. This allowed recasting Taylor expansion as a transformation of programs into superpositions of multilinear approximants, each capturing a finite computational behavior. The Taylor expansion has provided new and simpler proof methods to characterize the denotational and operational properties of programs. Differential linear logic similarly extends linear logic with new rules reflecting the logical structure of differentiation, yielding a sharper understanding of logical interaction. Differential linear logic has directly inspired unexpectedly effective accounts of differentiation in category theory, and strongly influenced current advances in higher-dimensional models of logic and computation. Differentiation has been instrumental in the design of new models of non-deterministic, probabilistic, quantum, or concurrent computation. After 20 years of intensive use, the concepts introduced in the awarded papers are time-tested and precious additions to the standard toolbox of the working linear logicians and programming language semanticists.<br/></li></ul><h2><a id="CPP2025" name="CPP2025" ></a>CPP 2025: Certified Programs and Proofs</h2><p class="meta">  20-21 January 2025, co-located with POPL 2025, Denver, USA</p><p class="meta">  <a href="https://popl25.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2025">https://popl25.sigplan.org/home/CPP-2025</a></p>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP) is an international conference on practical and theoretical topics in all areas that consider formal verification and certification as an essential paradigm for their work.

ASP was found to be closely related to SAT, which led to a new method of computing answer sets using SAT solvers and techniques adapted from SAT. This has been a much studied relationship, and is currently extended towards satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). The relationship of ASP to other computing paradigms, such as constraint satisfaction, quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), first-order logic (FOL), and FO(ID) is also the subject of active research. Consequently, new methods of computing answer sets are being developed based on relationships to these formalisms.<br/>   Furthermore, the practical applications of ASP also foster work on multi-paradigm problem-solving, and in particular language and solver integration. The most prominent examples in this area currently are the integration of ASP with description logics (in the realm of the Semantic Web) and constraint satisfaction (which recently led to the Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP) research direction).<br/>  A large body of general results regarding ASP is available and several efficient ASP solvers have been implemented. However, there are still significant challenges in applying ASP to real life applications, and more interest in relating ASP to other computing paradigms is emerging. This  workshop will provide opportunities for researchers to identify these challenges and to exchange ideas for overcoming them.<br/></li><li> TOPICS<br/>  For a full list of topics see <a href="https://sites.google.com/unical.it/aspocp2024/">https://sites.google.com/unical.it/aspocp2024/</a><br/></li><li> SUBMISSIONS<br/>  The workshop invites two types of submissions:<br/><ul><li> original papers describing original research. </li><li> non-original paper already published on formal proceedings or journals. </li></ul>  Original papers must not exceed 13 pages (excluding references) and must be formatted using the 1-column CEURART style available here.

Logic can be used, for instance, to express the agents' abilities, knowledge, and objectives. Strategic reasoning refers to algorithmic methods that allow for the development of good behavior for the agents of the system. At the intersection, we find logics that can express the existence of strategies or equilibria and can be used to reason about them. The LAMAS&SR workshop merges two international workshops: LAMAS (Logical Aspects of Multi-Agent Systems), which focuses on all kinds of logical aspects of multi-agent systems from the perspectives of artificial intelligence, computer science, and game theory, and SR (Strategic Reasoning), devoted to all aspects of strategic reasoning in formal methods and artificial intelligence. Over the years the communities and research themes of both workshops got closer and closer, with a significant overlap in the participants and organizers of both events. For this reason, the two events have been unified under the same flag, formally joining the two communities. As such, the LAMAS&SR workshop aims to bring together researchers working on different aspects of either logic or strategic reasoning in computer science, artificial intelligence, and multi-agent systems research, both from a theoretical and a practical viewpoint.<br/></li><li> TOPICS OF INTEREST<br/>  For a full list of the relevant topics visit the LAMAS24 website. <br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES<br/><table><tr><td>Paper submission deadline - EXTENDED: </td><td>Aug 14, 2024</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Acceptance notification: </td><td>Aug 21, 2024</td> </tr><tr><td>Camera-ready version deadline: </td><td>Sep 07, 2024</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>LAMAS&SR 2024 workshop: </td><td>Nov 2nd, 3rd, or 4ths 2024</td> </tr></table></li><li> SUBMISSION.<br/>  Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of up to 4 pages plus 1 page for references only, in the format of the KR 2024 conference (KR24_authors_kit.zip).

They are ideal for early-stage PhD students to get feedback on their research project during the initial planing and orientation phase. Abstracts have 2-3 pages, co-authors are allowed, and results may have been published previously if appropriately referenced. Indicate if also submitted to iFM2024. </li><li> Result Reports: are short papers summarizing preliminary results of early-stage research.  Result Reports are short papers summarizing preliminary results of early-stage research. They should objectively report the addressed question, applied methods, and obtained results. Papers on unexpected results or ineffective methods are particularly welcome. Result Reports have 3-6 pages, co-authors are allowed, the work must be previously unpublished. </li><li> Master summaries: are short papers summarizing the research question, method, and results of your impactful Master's thesis together with a discussion about possible next research steps. They are ideal for new and future PhD students to communicate their thesis results.  Master reports have 2-3 pages, an experienced supervisor should be a co-author, and results may have been published previously if appropriately referenced. Indicate if also submitted to iFM2024. </li></ul>  All submissions will be reviewed and accepted papers will be made publicly available in open-access online symposium proceedings.<br/></li><li> SUBMISSION GUIDELINES<br/>  Multiple submissions by one author are not permitted.

In a groundbreaking CAV 2017 paper, titled “Reluplex: An Efficient SMT Solver for Verifying Deep Neural Networks”, the authors, Clark Barrett, David Dill, Kyle Julian, Guy Katz, and Mykel Kochenderfer, developed a novel SMT-based algorithm, Reluplex, for verifying deep neural networks. The original algorithm was written to help verify the “Airborne Collision-Avoidance System for drone” system (ACAS-Xu).  Through Reluplex, the authors demonstrated, for the first time, that real-world neural networks could be verified. Reluplex could tackle neural networks that were over an order-of-magnitude larger as compared to previous verification techniques. <br/>  The Reluplex work had an immense impact on formal methods research, by creating a  highly active sub-field within the verification community, which is now center-stage in every major verification conference and is also subject to an annual competition dedicated specifically to the verification of neural networks (VNN-COMP). The Reluplex algorithm has been extended and enhanced, by the authors and by others, and the original paper has already accumulated more than 2000 citations (as of May 2024) – making it one of the most well-cited CAV papers in the past decades. Following their initial work, the authors continue to play a key role in solidifying the field of neural network verification.<br/>  For more information please check: <a href="https://i-cav.org/2024/cav-award/">https://i-cav.org/2024/cav-award/</a><br/>  The CAV Award Committee:<br/><ul><li> Corina Pasareanu (Chair), NASA </li><li> Rupak Majumdar, MPI-SWS </li><li> Ranjit Jhala, University of California, San Diego </li><li> Alessandro Cimatti, Fondazione Bruno Kessler </li></ul></li></ul><br><br><br>Links: <a href="http://siglog.org/">SIGLOG website</a>, <a href="https://lics.siglog.org">LICS website</a>, <a href="https://lics.siglog.org/newsletters/">SIGLOG Monthly</a>.</div></body></html>
