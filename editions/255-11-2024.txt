* SPECIAL SESSIONS
  There will be 6 special sessions, details will be announced soon.
* CONFERENCE TOPICS
  The CiE conferences serve as an interdisciplinary forum for research in all aspects of computability, foundations of computer science, logic, and theoretical computer science, as well as the interplay of these areas with practical issues in computer science and with other disciplines such as biology, mathematics, philosophy, or physics.
* PAPER SUBMISSION
 The Program Committee cordially invites all researchers, European and non-European, to submit their papers in all areas related to the above for presentation at the conference and inclusion in the proceedings of CiE 2025 at https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cie2025.
* CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS
  Papers submitted to the conference proceedings should represent original work, not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with formal proceedings. The Program Committee will rigorously review and select submitted papers. Accepted papers will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series from Springer-Verlag. Papers to be considered in the conferences proceedings must be submitted in PDF format, using the LNCS style (available at https://www.springer.com/gp/) and must have a maximum of 15 pages, including references but excluding a possible appendix in which one can include proofs and other additional material. Papers building bridges between different parts of the research community are particularly welcome.
* INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS
  Continuing the tradition of past CiE conferences, we invite researchers to present informal presentations of their recent work. A proposal for an informal presentation must be submitted via our submission link: https://easychair.org/my/, using the LNCS style file (available at https://www.springer.com/gp/), and be 1 page long; a brief description of the results suffices and an abstract is not required. Informal presentations will not be published in the LNCS conference proceedings. Results presented as informal presentations at CiE 2025 may appear or may have appeared in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals.
* WOMEN IN COMPUTABILITY
  We intend to run the Women in Computability program as in previous CiEs, details will be announced in due course.
* HOSTED BY
  The event will be held in the Faculdade de Ciências buildings located at University of Lisbon.





CAV 2025: 37th International Conference on Computer-Aided Verification

  https://conferences.i-cav.org/2025/cfp/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* CONFERENCE
  CAV 2025 is the 37th in a series dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for hardware and software systems. The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and techniques that are needed for their implementation. CAV considers it vital to continue spurring advances in hardware and software verification while expanding to new domains such as machine learning, autonomous systems, and computer security. The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A selection of papers is expected to be invited to a special issue of Formal Methods in System Design and the Journal of the ACM.

CALL FOR PAPERS
* FSCD (https://fscd-conference.org/) covers all aspects of formal structures for computation and deduction, from theoretical foundations to applications. Building on two communities, RTA (Rewriting Techniques and Applications) and TLCA (Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications), FSCD embraces their core topics and broadens their scope to closely related areas in logic, models of computation, semantics and verification in new challenging areas.                   
* IMPORTANT DATES
  All deadlines are midnight anywhere-on-earth (AoE); late submissions will not be considered.

* Submissions can be made in two categories: regular research papers and system descriptions. Please indicate in the submission page in Easychair and in the first page of the paper in which category you are submitting. Regular research papers are limited to 15 pages, excluding references and appendices. They must present original research which is unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. System descriptions are limited to 15 pages, excluding references. Shorter papers are welcome and will be given equal consideration. A system description must present new software tools, or significantly new versions of such tools, in which FSCD topics play an important role. An archive of the code with instructions on how to install and run the tool must be submitted. In addition, a webpage where the system can be experimented with should be provided.
