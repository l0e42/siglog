LFMTP 2025: Logical Frameworks and Meta-Languages - Theory and Practice
  July 19th, 2025, Birmingham, UK
  Affiliated with FSCD 2025
  https://lfmtp.github.io/lfmtp-page/workshops/2025/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* Logical frameworks and meta-languages form a common substrate for representing, implementing, and reasoning about a wide variety of deductive systems of interest in logic and computer science. Their design and implementation, and their use in reasoning tasks ranging from the correctness of software to the properties of formal computational systems, have been the focus of considerable research over the past three decades.
* The annual LFMTP workshop brings together designers, implementors, and practitioners to discuss various aspects of the structure and utility of logical frameworks, including the treatment of variable binding, inductive and co-inductive reasoning techniques, and qualitative aspects of reasoning including expressivity and lucidity.
* LFMTP 2025 will provide researchers a forum to present state-of-the-art techniques and discuss progress in areas such as the following:
 - Encoding and reasoning about the meta-theory of programming languages, logical systems and related formally specified systems.
 - Theoretical and practical issues concerning the treatment of variable binding, especially the representation of, and reasoning about, datatypes defined from binding signatures.
 - Logical treatments of inductive and co-inductive definitions and associated reasoning techniques, including inductive types of higher dimension in homotopy type theory
 - Graphical languages for building proofs, applications in geometry, equational reasoning and category theory.
 - New theory contributions: canonical and substructural frameworks, contextual frameworks, proof-theoretic foundations supporting binders, functional programming over logical frameworks, homotopy and cubical type theory.
 - Applications of logical frameworks: proof-carrying architectures, proof exchange and transformation, program refactoring, etc.
 - Techniques for programming with binders in functional programming languages such as Haskell, OCaml or Agda, and logic programming languages such as lambda Prolog or Alpha-Prolog.
* The workshop's program will include contributed and invited talks.

iFM 2025: 20th International Conference on Integrated Formal Methods
  Paris, France, November 19-21, 2025.
  https://ifm2025.ens.psl.eu/
CALL FOR PAPERS 
* Objectives and scope
  In the last decades, we have witnessed a proliferation of approaches that integrate several modelling, verification and simulation techniques, facilitating more versatile and efficient analysis of software-intensive systems. These approaches provide powerful support for the analysis of different functional and non-functional properties of the systems, complex interaction of components of different nature as well as validation of diverse aspects of system behaviour. The iFM conference series is a forum for discussing recent research advances in the development of integrated approaches to formal modelling and analysis. The conference covers all aspects of the design of integrated techniques, including language design, verification and validation, automated tool support and the use of such techniques in software engineering practice. To credit the effort of tool developers, we use EAPLS artifact badging.

* PAPER CATEGORIES 
  iFM 2025 solicits high-quality papers reporting research results and/or experience reports related to the overall theme of formal methods integration. We solicit papers in the following categories:
 - 1 Regular papers (limit 16 pages) presenting original scientific research results, tools, their foundation and evaluations, applications of formal methods, including rigorous evaluations and case studies.
 - 2 Short papers (limit 6 pages) describing any work in the area of formal methods, including work-in-progress and preliminary results that are sufficiently interesting for the iFM community.
  All page limits exclude the references. Appendices may be included, but they will only be read by a reviewer at their discretion. Regular and short papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will undergo a thorough review process. Submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. The review process is single blind. Submissions for all categories should be made using the iFM 2025 EasyChair site: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2025 . 
  Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files. Springer requires that authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. After a paper is accepted, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.
  The conference proceedings will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A special issue of the Formal Aspects of Computing journal is planned for extended versions of selected papers from iFM 2025. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by the early registration date.
* EAPLS ARTIFACT BADGING
  Reproducibility of experiments is crucial to foster an atmosphere of open, reusable and trustworthy research. To improve and reward reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of tool developers in our community, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit possible artifacts associated with their paper for evaluation, and based on the level of reproducibility they will be awarded one or more badges. See https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/. Artifact submission is optional and the result of the artifact evaluation will not alter the paper’s acceptance decision.
* BEST PAPER  
  iFM 2025 will honor the best paper selected with respect to reviews, program committee discussions and conference presentations with an award.
* CONTACT 
  In case of questions, please contact ifm2025@easychair.org.
