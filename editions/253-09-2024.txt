LPNMR 2024: 17th International Conference on Logic Programming and Non-monotonic Reasoning
  October 11-14, 2024 Dallas, Texas, USA 
  https://lpnmr2024.demacs.unical.it/
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
* AIMS AND SCOPE
  LPNMR 2024 is the seventeenth in the series of international meetings on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the design and implementation of logic-based programming languages and database systems, and those working in knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR strives to encompass theoretical and experimental studies that have led or will lead to advances in declarative programming and knowledge representation, as well as their use in practical applications. A Doctoral Consortium will also be a part of the program.
* LPNMR 2024 aims to bring together researchers from LPNMR core areas and application areas of  the aforementioned kind in order to share research experiences, promote collaboration and identify directions for joint future research. LPNMR 2024 is co-located with ICLP 2024.
* REGISTRATION

* LPNMR 2024 will be held on the campus of the University of Texas at Dallas in October 2024. Dallas, part of the Dallas/Fort-Worth metroplex, is a dynamic city with great tourist attractions. Renowned for its unique blend of modernity and rich cultural heritage, Dallas offers an array of attractions for visitors: from diverse range of museums, such as the Dallas Museum of Art and the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, to the Fort Worth Stockyards that feature the Cattle Drive (twice daily). Dallas boasts a thriving culinary scene, from sizzling steakhouses to trendy food trucks, to authentic Tex-Mex cuisine. With a wealth of entertainment options, including shopping districts, live music venues, and sports events, a visit to Dallas is a memorable experience. The conference will be held as an in-person event.
