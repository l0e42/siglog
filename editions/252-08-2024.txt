CHURCH AWARD 2024
AWARD -s SIGLOG MATTER
* The 2024 Alonzo Church Award for Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation is presented jointly to Thomas Ehrhard and Laurent Regnier for giving a logical and computational account of differentiation, bringing Taylor expansion to the Curry-Howard correspondence, which had a major impact on programming language semantics.
* The awarded papers are: 
  - Thomas Ehrhard. “Finiteness spaces”. In: Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 15.4 (2005), pp. 615–646. doi: 10.1017/S0960129504004645
  - Thomas Ehrhard and Laurent Regnier. “The differential lambda-calculus”. In: Theoretical Computer Science 309.1-3 (2003), pp. 1–41. doi: 10.1016/S0304-3975(03)00392-X

* The nominated papers introduced differential lambda-calculus and differential linear logic, together with the Taylor expansion of terms and proofs. The extension of the lambda-calculus with a derivation operator gives a syntactic account of differentiation, which reconciles the computational, logical, and algebraic notions of linearity. This allowed recasting Taylor expansion as a transformation of programs into superpositions of multilinear approximants, each capturing a finite computational behavior. The Taylor expansion has provided new and simpler proof methods to characterize the denotational and operational properties of programs. Differential linear logic similarly extends linear logic with new rules reflecting the logical structure of differentiation, yielding a sharper understanding of logical interaction. Differential linear logic has directly inspired unexpectedly effective accounts of differentiation in category theory, and strongly influenced current advances in higher-dimensional models of logic and computation. Differentiation has been instrumental in the design of new models of non-deterministic, probabilistic, quantum, or concurrent computation. After 20 years of intensive use, the concepts introduced in the awarded papers are time-tested and precious additions to the standard toolbox of the working linear logicians and programming language semanticists.

ASPOCP 2024: 17th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms
  https://sites.google.com/unical.it/aspocp2024/    
  October 12-13, Dallas, Texas
  Affiliated with ICLP 2024, 40th International Conference on Logic Programming
CALL FOR PAPERS
* AIMS AND SCOPE
  Since its introduction in the late 1980s, Answer Set Programming (ASP) has been widely applied to various knowledge-intensive tasks and combinatorial search problems. ASP was found to be closely related to SAT, which led to a new method of computing answer sets using SAT solvers and techniques adapted from SAT. This has been a much studied relationship, and is currently extended towards satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). The relationship of ASP to other computing paradigms, such as constraint satisfaction, quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), first-order logic (FOL), and FO(ID) is also the subject of active research. Consequently, new methods of computing answer sets are being developed based on relationships to these formalisms.
   Furthermore, the practical applications of ASP also foster work on multi-paradigm problem-solving, and in particular language and solver integration. The most prominent examples in this area currently are the integration of ASP with description logics (in the realm of the Semantic Web) and constraint satisfaction (which recently led to the Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP) research direction).
  A large body of general results regarding ASP is available and several efficient ASP solvers have been implemented. However, there are still significant challenges in applying ASP to real life applications, and more interest in relating ASP to other computing paradigms is emerging. This  workshop will provide opportunities for researchers to identify these challenges and to exchange ideas for overcoming them.

LAMAS&SR 2024: International Workshop on Logical Aspects of Multi-Agent Systems and Strategic Reasoning
  November 2 - 4, 2024, Hanoi, Vietnam
  Co-located with KR 2024, International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
  https://conferences-website.github.io/lamassr24/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* OVERVIEW
  Logic and strategic reasoning play a central role in multi-agent systems. Logic can be used, for instance, to express the agents' abilities, knowledge, and objectives. Strategic reasoning refers to algorithmic methods that allow for the development of good behavior for the agents of the system. At the intersection, we find logics that can express the existence of strategies or equilibria and can be used to reason about them. The LAMAS&SR workshop merges two international workshops: LAMAS (Logical Aspects of Multi-Agent Systems), which focuses on all kinds of logical aspects of multi-agent systems from the perspectives of artificial intelligence, computer science, and game theory, and SR (Strategic Reasoning), devoted to all aspects of strategic reasoning in formal methods and artificial intelligence. Over the years the communities and research themes of both workshops got closer and closer, with a significant overlap in the participants and organizers of both events. For this reason, the two events have been unified under the same flag, formally joining the two communities. As such, the LAMAS&SR workshop aims to bring together researchers working on different aspects of either logic or strategic reasoning in computer science, artificial intelligence, and multi-agent systems research, both from a theoretical and a practical viewpoint.

CAV AWARD 2024
AWARD
* We are pleased to announce that the Computer Aided Verification (CAV) 2024 Award is given to: Clark Barrett, David Dill, Kyle Julian, Guy Katz, and Mykel Kochenderfer for their CAV 2017 paper titled “Reluplex: An Efficient SMT Solver for Verifying Deep Neural Networks”. 
  Deep neural networks are a state-of-the-art machine learning technology, which has become dominant in many areas within computer science. In a groundbreaking CAV 2017 paper, titled “Reluplex: An Efficient SMT Solver for Verifying Deep Neural Networks”, the authors, Clark Barrett, David Dill, Kyle Julian, Guy Katz, and Mykel Kochenderfer, developed a novel SMT-based algorithm, Reluplex, for verifying deep neural networks. The original algorithm was written to help verify the “Airborne Collision-Avoidance System for drone” system (ACAS-Xu).  Through Reluplex, the authors demonstrated, for the first time, that real-world neural networks could be verified. Reluplex could tackle neural networks that were over an order-of-magnitude larger as compared to previous verification techniques. 
  The Reluplex work had an immense impact on formal methods research, by creating a  highly active sub-field within the verification community, which is now center-stage in every major verification conference and is also subject to an annual competition dedicated specifically to the verification of neural networks (VNN-COMP). The Reluplex algorithm has been extended and enhanced, by the authors and by others, and the original paper has already accumulated more than 2000 citations (as of May 2024) – making it one of the most well-cited CAV papers in the past decades. Following their initial work, the authors continue to play a key role in solidifying the field of neural network verification.
