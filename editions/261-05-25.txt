FM 2026: 27th international symposium on Formal Methods
  May 20--22, 2026 Tokyo, Japan
  https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026
CALL FOR PAPERS
* FM 2026 is the 27th international symposium on Formal Methods in a series organized by Formal Methods Europe (FME), an independent association whose aim is to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for software development. The FM symposia have been successful in bringing together researchers and industrial users around a program of original papers on research and industrial experience, workshops, tutorials, reports on tools, projects, and ongoing doctoral research. FM 2026 will be both an occasion to celebrate and a platform for enthusiastic researchers and practitioners from a diversity of backgrounds to exchange their ideas and share their experiences. See https://conf.researchr.org/home/fm-2026
  The FM 2026 proceedings will appear as part of the LNCS FM subline, with gold open access.
* IMPORTANT DATES
 -dh Abstract Submission:     November 25, 2025
 -dh Full Paper Submission:   December 2, 2025
 -d Paper Notification:  January 30, 2026
 -d Final Version:     February 23, 2026
 -dv Main Conference: May 20-22, 2026
* TOPICS OF INTEREST 
  FM 2026 will highlight the development and application of formal methods in a wide range of domains including trustworthy AI, computer-based systems, systems-of-systems, cyber-physical systems, security, human-computer interaction, manufacturing, sustainability, energy, transport, smart cities, smart contracts in blockchain, healthcare and biology. We particularly welcome papers on techniques, tools, and experiences in interdisciplinary settings. We also welcome papers on experiences of applying formal methods in industrial settings, and on the design and validation of formal method tools.
 - Track: Tests & Proofs
  FM 2026 features a special track on Tests and Proofs (TAP) as a part of the conference. TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.
  Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration. The verification of systems based on machine learning spurs novel combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g., property verification of surrogate models that are generated through testing.
  TAP's scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology, including foundational work, tool development, and empirical research. Topics of interest center around the combination of static techniques such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.
* SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
  We solicit various categories of papers:
 - Regular Papers (max 15 pages)
 - Regular Papers, submitted to the TAP track (max 15 pages)
 - Long tool papers (max 15 pages)
 - Case study papers (max 15 pages)
 - Short papers (max 6 pages), including tool demonstration papers
  All page limits do not include references and appendices. For more details on submissions and guidelines please visit our website. 
* Best Paper Award 
  At the conference, the PC Chairs will present an award to the authors of the submission selected as the FM 2026 Best Paper.
* Special Issue
  Extended versions of selected papers will be invited for publication in a special issue of a journal to be announced soon.
* Program Committee Chairs
