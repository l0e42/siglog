FACS 24: 20th International Conference on Formal Aspects of Component Software
  September 09-10, 2024, Milan, Italy
  https://facs-conference.github.io/2024/
  Co-located with the 26th international symposium on formal methods (FM 2024) https://www.fm24.polimi.it/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* OVERVIEW
  FACS 2024 is concerned with how formal methods can be applied to component- based software and system development. Formal methods have provided foundations for component-based software through research on mathematical models for components, composition and adaptation, and rigorous approaches to verification, deployment, testing, and certification.
* TOPICS
  - Formal methods, models, and languages for software-intensive systems, components and services, including verification techniques (e.g., model checking, theorem proving, testing, constraint solving, runtime analysis), probabilistic techniques, (co-)simulation techniques, composition and deployment, component interaction, software variability, QoS and other nonfunctional properties (e.g., trust, compliance, security, privacy);
  - Formal aspects of concrete software-intensive systems, including service- oriented architectures, business processes, cloud or edge computing, real- time/safety-critical systems, hybrid and cyber physical systems, quantum systems, components that use artificial intelligence;
  - Tools supporting formal methods for components and services; - Case studies and experience reports over the above topics;
  - **Special track: Formal Methods of Component Software in the context of emerging computational paradigms** (e.g. cyber physical human systems, quantum computations, AI systems, blockchain systems, etc) .
* SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION
  We solicit high-quality submissions reporting on:
  - A: full papers: original research, applications and experiences, or surveys (16 pages);
  - B: short papers: tools and demonstrations (6 pages);
  - C: Special track papers (16 pages);

WADT 2024: 27th International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques
  Enschede, the Netherlands
  https://conf.researchr.org/home/wadt-2024
  Part of the STAF 2024 multi-conference
  Mon 8 – Fri 12 July 2024
CALL FOR PAPERS
* AIMS AND SCOPE
  The algebraic approach to system specification encompasses many aspects of the formal design of software systems. Originally born as a formal method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now covers new specification frameworks and programming paradigms (such as object-oriented, aspect-oriented, agent-oriented, logic and higher-order functional programming) as well as a wide range of application areas (including information systems, concurrent, distributed and mobile systems). The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.
* TOPICS OF INTEREST 
  Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are: 
  - Foundations of algebraic specification 
  - Other approaches to formal specification, including process calculi and models of concurrent, distributed, and cyber-physical systems
  - Specification languages, methods, and environments
  - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques
  - Model-driven development
  - Graph transformations, term rewriting, and proof systems
  - Integration of formal specification techniques
  - Theorem-proving technologies and integration with specification languages
  - Formal testing and quality assurance, validation, and verification
  - Algebraic approaches to knowledge representation and cognitive sciences
* WORKSHOP FORMAT AND LOCATION
  The workshop will be part of the STAF 2024 multi-conference at Twente, the Netherlands. Presentations will be selected on the basis of submitted abstracts.
* IMPORTANT DATES
  -dh (Extended) Abstract submission: 10 May 2024
  -d Abstract notification: 17 May 2024
  -dh Full-paper submission: 16 Sep 2024
  -d Full-paper notification: 25 Nov 2024
* SUBMISSIONS 
  The scientific programme of the workshop will include presentations of recent results or ongoing research as well as invited talks. The presentations will be selected by the Programme Committee on the basis of submitted abstracts according to originality, significance and general interest. Abstracts must not exceed two pages, including references, in LNCS format. If a longer version of the contribution is available, it can be made accessible on the web and referenced in the abstract.
  The abstracts will have to be submitted electronically via EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=staf2024.
* PROCEEDINGS
  After the workshop, authors will be invited to submit full papers for the refereed proceedings. All submissions will be reviewed by the Programme Committee. The selection of papers will be based on originality, soundness, and significance of the presented ideas and results. The post-proceedings will then be published by Springer as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
* SPONSORSHIP 
  The workshop takes place under the auspices of IFIP WG 1.3.
