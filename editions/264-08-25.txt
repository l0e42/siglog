SCML: A PUBLICATION FORUM FOR SYMBOLIC COMPUTATION AND MACHINE LEARNING
  An Initiative of the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC)
  https://scml.risc.jku.at
CALL FOR PAPERS
* The SCML publishing forum is dedicated to all research that strives to combine Symbolic Computation (SC) and Machine Learning (ML) as two major approaches to "Artificial Intelligence", in particular the application of ML to SC, the application of SC to ML, and the hybrid combination of SC and ML to solving problems. We consider submissions that explore the interaction between the two fields - not
  standalone works on either SC or ML. 
* SCML papers can be continuously submitted and enter the reviewing process immediately after their submission. The final versions of accepted papers are published in the electronic "RISC Proceedings on Symbolic Computation and Machine Learning".
* Authors of accepted papers are expected to present them at a subsequent SCML workshop. These workshops take place in semi-regular intervals in purely online form (via Zoom), typically in half a day.
* Authors of accepted SCML papers that present original research may be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to the SCML Track of the Journal of Symbolic Computation.

Message from the SIGLOG Chair
MISC -s SIGLOG MATTER
* Dear colleagues,
  There is some exciting news about SIGLOG:
  As you may remember from my previous letters, about two years ago ACM decided to increase the overhead charges—i.e., the SIG's annual management fee—and for SIGLOG, the overhead would have risen to 25,000 USD (from the 10,000 USD it had been previously). We could not come up with a viable financial plan to cover this fee, and consequently, we explored the possibility of merging SIGLOG with SIGPLAN. This option, however, was not very popular among our community, as shown by the results of the recent consultation about LICS’s institutional future, promoted by the LICS steering committee. In the same consultation, LICS explored the possibility of becoming an independent conference, which appeared to be a far more popular option.
  This July, the other members of the SIGLOG Executive Committee and I, along with Igor Walukiewicz, the chair of the LICS steering committee, had a meeting with Neha Kumar and Jens Palsberg, the chairs of the SIG Governing Board. We reported the news about the consultation, and in particular, the unwillingness of our community to join SIGPLAN. They explained that we were not alone in this situation; there were other small SIGs that had also been struggling with the overhead increase and were unable to join other SIGs. As a consequence, the SGB started a working group that is planning to revise the overhead formula, with the express goal of helping small SIGs achieve financial stability. They said the current formula was devised to help cover the financial cost of ACM’s transition toward open access. Since institutional support for the new ACM publication model is exceeding expectations, ACM can afford more flexibility toward the SIGs.
  Neha invited the members of the SIGLOG Executive Committee to participate in the working group mentioned above. The goals of this group are not only to revise the SIGs’ overhead formula, but also to rethink the overall SIG structure, and to devise a strategy to cover the publication fees of SIG authors whose institutions do not subscribe to the ACM open access program (authors from subscribing institutions are already covered, of course). We will begin these meetings in August, and hopefully, we will be able to report some good, concrete news soon. Stay tuned!
  I would also like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to everyone who subscribed to SIGLOG following our appeal several months ago. Your response has been very encouraging—our membership has grown from 185 to around 240. However, the numbers are now declining slowly, probably because older memberships are expiring and some people are not renewing. Hence, I would like to renew our appeal to become a SIGLOG member, or to renew your membership: a strong show of community support is vital as we work with ACM to ensure favorable terms for SIGLOG.
  Catuscia Palamidessi
  Chair of the SIGLOG EC

Alain Colmerauer Award: The 2025 edition of the Alain Colmerauer Prize
CALL FOR NOMINATIONS
* Organized by the Association for Logic Programming
* In the summer of 1972, Alain Colmerauer and his team in Marseille developed and implemented the first version of the logic programming language Prolog. Together with both earlier and later collaborations with Robert Kowalski and his colleagues in Edinburgh, this work laid the practical and theoretical foundations for the Prolog and logic programming of today. Prolog and its related technologies soon became key tools of symbolic programming and Artificial Intelligence.
  2022 was celebrated as the Year of Prolog to recognize the 50th anniversary of these events and highlight the continuing significance of Prolog and Logic Programming both for symbolic, explainable AI, and for computing more generally. The celebration inaugurated the ALP Alain Colmerauer Prolog Heritage Prize (in short: the Alain Colmerauer Prize). 2025 marks the fourth awarding of the Alain Colmerauer Prize.
  The Prize is given for recent accomplishments and practical advances in Prolog-inspired computing, understood in a broad sense, where foundational, technological and practical contributions are eligible with proven evidence or potential for the future development of Logic Programming.
* The 2025 Award
  Nominations are sought for the 2025 edition of the Alain Colmerauer Prize.
* Eligibility
  Any individual or group of individuals can nominate themselves or their institution(s)/organization(s) for the Prize. Nominations should describe work that meets the purpose of the Prize. Submissions that address the well-being of society or of the planet are especially welcome.
* Submissions
  Nominations should explain the contribution and argue for its present and future significance. The submissions must not exceed three pages plus references and may optionally be accompanied by up to two letters of support no longer than 500 words each. Submissions should be made by the candidates themselves, in pdf, through EasyChair: https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=acprize2025
* Selection and award
  The Prize is given for depth, novelty, and proven or potential impact. The winner is selected by the Jury from the submitted nominations in consultation with the Executive Committee of the Association for Logic Programming. Furthermore, a shortlist of up to five finalists may also be selected in the process. The Jury will provide a detailed citation that explains the basis of the awarding of the Prize.
  The winner receives a certificate and cash support of up to 2,000 Euros for attending the conference and award ceremony. If there are multiple winners, this amount is shared. Finalists also receive certificates.
* Important dates
 -dh Deadline for submissions: August 19, 2025.
 -d Notification for shortlist: August 23, 2025.
  - Award and presentation of the 2025 Prize: The winner of the 2025 Prize will be announced at the 41st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2025, Rende, Italy 9-19 September 2025). https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/
