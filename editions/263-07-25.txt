SIR@IWCS2025: First Workshop on Semantics for Interdisciplinary Research
  Dusseldorf, Germany
  September 24 2025
  https://team.inria.fr/semagramme/first-workshop-on-semantics-for-interdisciplinary-research/
  https://openreview.net/group?id=inria.fr/INRIA/S%C3%A9magramme/2025/SIR01
CALL FOR PAPERS
* In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has increasingly intersected with the humanities and social sciences, offering new methodologies for analyzing textual data, interpreting meaning, and modelling language-based phenomena. The potential for multi-disciplinary research using NLP methods is particularly great in computational semantics (CS), as its ability to process and represent meaning opens up innovative pathways for researchers in history, philosophy, literary studies, political science, etc.  This workshop aims to explore how semantic models and tools can be leveraged to tackle traditional and emerging questions in the Humanities in a broader sense (Social Sciences, Law, Economics, Management, Literature, Languages, Art, …). A major theme of  SIR is the role of semantics in NLP applied to the humanities (both statistical and symbolic approaches).

REACTS'25: International Workshop on Reconfigurable Transition Systems: Semantics, Logics and Applications
  https://reacts-workshop.github.io/2025/
  Tuesday, 10-11 November 2025
  Toledo, Spain
  Satellite event of SEFM 2025 (https://sefm-conference.github.io/sefm2025)
CALL FOR PAPERS
* OVERVIEW
  Reconfigurable Transition Systems (RTS) are dynamic relational structures (graphs) that evolve along its execution, in the sense that their accessibility relation, their set of nodes or their labelling change when their edges are crossed. These structures have proven to be suitable to compactly represent complex reactive and reconfigurable behaviours. Namely, the ability of reacting or readapting under the influence of certain events is a very distinctive feature of many diverse situations and objects. An autonomous vehicle that changes its route due to a new strike occurring, the behaviour of a software component after a memory disposal, or a DNA mutation as the result of a viral infection, are different examples that witness the importance of modelling about changes in a determined situation. Practical user cases have aroused the interest of the logic community in the study of variants of RTS, by developing formal methods to properly reason about such situations.
  This workshop aims to bring together the whole community of researchers working on different ways to model reconfigurable and reactive systems from a formal perspective. This includes theoretical approaches (like hybrid logics, reactive frames, model-update logics, and topological and algebraic semantics), or formalisms designed for specific purposes (like separation logic in software verification, dynamic epistemic logic in AI planning, and others). Also, our goal is to devise novel approaches and potential applications, and share a common perspective on the discipline.
* SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
  Authors are invited to submit, via CMT, research contributions or experience reports (https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/reacts2025). All papers should be written in English and prepared using the specific LNCS templates available at http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html. There are two categories of submissions:
 - FULL PAPERS up to 12 pages (excluding references) – to present original research and the analysis, interpretation and validation of the research findings.
 - SHORT PRESENTATIONS up to 4 pages (excluding references) – to present work in progress and preliminary results.
  Both kinds of submissions allow system descriptions,  to present a new tool, a new tool component or novel extensions to an existing tool aiming at supporting open community approaches, or the use/customisation of an existing tool in the context of RTS. Accepted full papers will be included in the workshop programme and will appear in the workshop LNCS proceedings. Accepted short presentations will be included in the pre-proceeding (available online before the Workshop) but not published in the LNCS proceedings.
* PROGRAM CO-CHAIRS
- José Proença, University of Porto (Portugal)
- Umberto Rivieccio, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (Spain)
* PUBLICATION
  Accepted full papers will be published by Springer in a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (http://www.springer.com/lncs), which will collect contributions to some workshops co-located with SEFM 2025. Condition for inclusion in proceedings is that at least one of the co-authors has presented the paper at the Workshop. Similarly to the last edition of ReacTS, we plan to invite authors of selected contributions to submit extended versions to a special issue, e.g. to the Journal of Applied Logics.
