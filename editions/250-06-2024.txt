CALL FOR PAPERS
* AIMS AND SCOPE
  LPNMR 2024 is the seventeenth in the series of international meetings on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the design and implementation of logic-based programming languages and database systems, and those working in knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR strives to encompass theoretical and experimental studies that have led or will lead to advances in declarative programming and knowledge representation, as well as their use in practical applications. LPNMR 2024 aims to bring together researchers from LPNMR core areas and application areas of the aforementioned kind in order to share research experiences, promote collaboration and identify directions for joint future research.

LAMAS&SR 2024: International Workshop on Logical Aspects of Multi-Agent Systems and Strategic Reasoning
  November 2 - 4, 2024, Hanoi, Vietnam
  Co-located with KR 2024, International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
  https://conferences-website.github.io/lamassr24/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* OVERVIEW
  Logic and strategic reasoning play a central role in multi-agent systems. Logic can be used, for instance, to express the agents' abilities, knowledge, and objectives. Strategic reasoning refers to algorithmic methods that allow for the development of good behavior for the agents of the system. At the intersection, we find logics that can express the existence of strategies or equilibria and can be used to reason about them. The LAMAS&SR workshop merges two international workshops: LAMAS (Logical Aspects of Multi-Agent Systems), which focuses on all kinds of logical aspects of multi-agent systems from the perspectives of artificial intelligence, computer science, and game theory, and SR (Strategic Reasoning), devoted to all aspects of strategic reasoning in formal methods and artificial intelligence. Over the years the communities and research themes of both workshops got closer and closer, with a significant overlap in the participants and organizers of both events. For this reason, the two events have been unified under the same flag, formally joining the two communities. As such, the LAMAS&SR workshop aims to bring together researchers working on different aspects of either logic or strategic reasoning in computer science, artificial intelligence, and multi-agent systems research, both from a theoretical and a practical viewpoint.
