  Co-located with the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS 2026) https://www.etaps.org/2026/
CALL FOR PAPERS

  Deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth
* TOPICS OF INTEREST
  Blockchain is a novel technology to store data in a decentralized way. Although originally invented to enable cryptocurrencies, it quickly found applications in several other domains. Blockchains may also provide support for Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are scripts written in ad-hoc programming languages, stored on the blockchain and executed by the network. They can interact with the ledger’s data and update its state, expressing the logic of possibly complex contracts between users of the blockchain and facilitating economic activity.
  Since blockchains are often used to store financial transactions, bugs may result in huge economic losses. It is therefore of utmost importance to obtain strong guarantees of the behaviour of blockchain software. Such guarantees can be achieved using Formal Methods. Blockchain software encompasses many areas where Formal Methods are relevant, including consensus algorithms ensuring liveness and security, smart contract programming languages, and cryptographic protocols such as zero-knowledge proofs.
  This workshop is a forum to identify theoretical and practical approaches of formal methods for Blockchain technology. Topics include, but are not limited to:
 - Formal models of Blockchain applications or concepts
 - Formal methods for consensus protocols
 - Formal methods for Blockchain-specific cryptographic primitives or protocols
 - Design and implementation of Smart Contract languages
 - Verification of Smart Contracts
 - Zero-knowledge proofs and their applications in a blockchain setting
* SUBMISSION

Page limits are 12 pages for full papers and 6 pages for short and tool papers, excluding bibliography and a short appendix of up to 5 additional pages. Alternatively, authors may submit an extended abstract of up to 2 pages excluding bibliography, summarizing ongoing work in the area of formal methods and blockchains. Extended abstracts will not be included in the proceedings, but authors of selected submissions will be invited to give a lightning talk.

  Authors are encouraged to use LaTeX and prepare submissions according to the OASIcs instructions and style guides provided by Dagstuhl: https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors#oasics At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the workshop as a registered participant.

  July 17–19, 2026, Lisbon, Portugal
  Website: https://nmr.krportal.org/2026/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* GENERAL INFORMATION
 NMR is the premier forum for results in the area of Nonmonotonic Reasoning. Its aim is to bring together active researchers in this broad field within knowledge representation and reasoning (KR), including belief revision, uncertain reasoning, reasoning about actions, planning, logic programming, preferences, argumentation, causality, and many other related topics including systems and applications. Visit also the general NMR webpage: https://nmr.krportal.org/ .
  NMR has a long history - it started in 1984 and, up until 2020, was held every two years. Recent previous NMR workshops were held in Melbourne (2025), Vietnam (2024), Greece (2023), Haifa (2022), Hanoi (virtually) (2021), Rhodes (virtually) (2020), Tempe (2018), Cape Town (2016), Vienna (2014), Rome (2012), Toronto (2010), and Sydney (2008).
  NMR 2026 is co-located with the 23rd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (https://kr.org/KR2026/) at the Federated Logic Conference (https://www.floc26.org/).
* AIMS AND SCOPE
 NMR 2026 aims to foster connections between the different subareas of nonmonotonic reasoning and provide a forum for emerging topics. We especially invite papers on systems and applications, as well as position papers addressing benchmark issues. The workshop will be structured by topical sessions fitting to the scopes of accepted papers. Workshop activities will include invited talks and presentations of technical papers.

They should introduce work that has recently been published or is under review, or ongoing research at an advanced stage. We highly encourage to attach to the submission a preprint/postprint or a technical report. Such extra material will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. Submitting already published material may require a permission by the copyright holder.
  All submissions should be formatted in CEUR style (1-column). Author kit: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip . Papers must be submitted in PDF only.
