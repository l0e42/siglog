FLOPS 2026: 18th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming
  May 26-28, 2026, Akita, Japan
  https://functional-logic.org/events/flops/2026/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and implementers of declarative programming, to discuss mutually interesting results and common problems: theoretical advances, their implementations in language systems and tools, and applications of these systems in practice. The scope includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory, applications, implementations, and teaching of declarative programming. FLOPS specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization between theory and practice and among different styles of declarative programming.
* The call is now open. 
* Important dates:
  -dh Abstracts due: Dec 8, 2025

Theorietag: 88th Workshop on Algorithms, Complexity, and Logic 
  9th-10th October 2025
  University of Augsburg, Germany
  https://uni-a.de/to/fai-theorietag2025/
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
* ABOUT 
  The 88th Workshop in Algorithms, Complexity, and Logic, commonly known as "Theorietag", is a joint workshop of the three working groups on Algorithms, Complexity, and Logic of the German Society for Computer Science (GI). 
  It aims at bringing together researchers from these three core research areas of theoretical computer science and to foster a broad scientific exchange. Moreover, the workshop is a great opportunity for younger researchers to present their work and to connect. There are no formal proceedings, so both published and unpublished work can be presented, without interfering with any past or future publication. A declared goal of the workshop is to enable contact between young and senior scientists.
* INVITED SPEAKERS
 - Thomas Bläsius (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology)
 - Javier Esparza (Technical University Munich)
 - Daniel Neuen (Max Planck Institute for Computer Science, Saarbrücken)
* CONTRIBUTED TALKS:
  We are looking for contributed talks in all areas of research on Algorithms, Complexity and Logic. These can be on recently published research, work in progress, or thesis projects.
  If you are interested in giving a contributed talk, then please send your title+abstract to theorietag2025@informatik.uni-augsburg.de by 
  - dh abstract submission: 26 September 2025
* REGISTRATION:
 The registration is open at least until 26th September 2025. Attending the workshop will be free of charge. Coffee/tea+fingerfood will be provided. Lunch and social dinner is self-paid. If you want to attend the workshop (with or without talk), then please register by sending an email to: theorietag2025@informatik.uni-augsburg.de
