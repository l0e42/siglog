These approaches provide powerful support for the analysis of different functional and non-functional properties of the systems, complex interaction of components of different nature as well as validation of diverse aspects of system behaviour. The iFM conference series is a forum for discussing recent research advances in the development of integrated approaches to formal modelling and analysis. The conference covers all aspects of the design of integrated techniques, including language design, verification and validation, automated tool support and the use of such techniques in software engineering practice. To credit the effort of tool developers, we use EAPLS artifact badging.<br/>  For a full list of areas of interest please visit the website<br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES (AoE)<br/><table><tr><td>Abstract Submission: </td><td>May 30, 2025</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Paper Submission: </td><td>Jun 06, 2025</td> </tr><tr><td>Author Notification: </td><td>Aug 08, 2025</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Artifact Registration: </td><td>Aug 15, 2025</td> </tr><tr><td>Artifact Submission 22: </td><td>Aug 01, 2025</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Artifact Notification 19: </td><td>Sep 01, 2025</td> </tr><tr><td>Camera-Ready Papers: </td><td>Sep 26, 2025</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>iFM 2025 main conference: </td><td>Nov 19-21, 2025</td> </tr></table></li><li> PAPER CATEGORIES <br/>  iFM 2025 solicits high-quality papers reporting research results and/or experience reports related to the overall theme of formal methods integration. We solicit papers in the following categories:<br/><ul><li> 1 Regular papers (limit 16 pages) presenting original scientific research results, tools, their foundation and evaluations, applications of formal methods, including rigorous evaluations and case studies. </li><li> 2 Short papers (limit 6 pages) describing any work in the area of formal methods, including work-in-progress and preliminary results that are sufficiently interesting for the iFM community. </li></ul>  All page limits exclude the references. Appendices may be included, but they will only be read by a reviewer at their discretion. Regular and short papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will undergo a thorough review process. Submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. The review process is single blind. Submissions for all categories should be made using the iFM 2025 EasyChair site: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2025">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2025</a> . <br/>  Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files. Springer requires that authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. After a paper is accepted, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.<br/>  The conference proceedings will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A special issue of the Formal Aspects of Computing journal is planned for extended versions of selected papers from iFM 2025. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by the early registration date.<br/></li><li> EAPLS ARTIFACT BADGING<br/>  Reproducibility of experiments is crucial to foster an atmosphere of open, reusable and trustworthy research. To improve and reward reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of tool developers in our community, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit possible artifacts associated with their paper for evaluation, and based on the level of reproducibility they will be awarded one or more badges. See <a href="https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/">https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/</a>. Artifact submission is optional and the result of the artifact evaluation will not alter the paper’s acceptance decision.<br/></li><li> BEST PAPER  <br/>  iFM 2025 will honor the best paper selected with respect to reviews, program committee discussions and conference presentations with an award.<br/></li><li> CONTACT <br/>  In case of questions, please contact ifm2025@easychair.org.<br/></li><li> Co-Located Events<br/>  The 7th International Workshop on Formal Methods for Autonomous Systems (<a href="https://fmasworkshop.github.io/">https://fmasworkshop.github.io/</a>) and the iFM PhD Symposium will be co-located with iFM 2025.<br/></li></ul><h2><a id="DC2025" name="DC2025" ></a>DC 2025: 21st Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming</h2>CALL FOR PAPERS<ul><li> The 21st Doctoral Consortium (DC) on Logic Programming provides students with the opportunity to present and discuss their research directions, and to obtain feedback from both peers and experts in the field. The preliminary website of the DC can be found at: <a href="https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/affiliated-events/doctoral-consortium">https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/affiliated-events/doctoral-consortium</a><br/></li><li> The DC will take place during the 41st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP) <a href="https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/">https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/</a> (September 12-19, 2025), hosted by the University of Calabria, Italy. The best paper from the DC will be given the opportunity to make a presentation in a session of the main ICLP conference. We aim to find sponsoring to cover the registration cost of students participating in the DC, but this still has to be confirmed.<br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES<br/><table><tr><td>Paper submission: </td><td>Jun 01, 2025</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Notification: </td><td>Jul 06, 2025</td> </tr><tr><td>Camera-ready copy: </td><td>Aug 06, 2025</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Presentations: </td><td>Sep 12-13, 2025</td> </tr></table></li><li> DC students are highly recommended to attend the Autumn School on Logic Programming and Constraint Programming on: Friday and Saturday, September 12-13, 2025: <a href="https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/affiliated-events/autumn-school-on-logic-programming">https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/affiliated-events/autumn-school-on-logic-programming</a><br/></li><li> AUDIENCE The DC is designed for students currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program, though we are also open to exceptions (e.g., students currently in a Master's program and interested in doctoral studies).
