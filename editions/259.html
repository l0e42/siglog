In coordination with the IJCAI’25 program chairs, we have therefore instituted a process by which authors can submit revised versions of such rejected papers directly to ICLP’25. Authors must submit a cover letter explaining how they have addressed the critical issues raised by IJCAI’25 reviewers before submitting their revised paper to the IJCAI Fast Track of ICLP’25. The submission will then enter the “revision” phase and be considered for publication in TPLP.  </li><li> Recently Published Research Track: Detailed information will be announced separately. </li></ul></li><li> AFFILIATED EVENTS<br/><ul><li> Workshops: September 12-14, 2025 </li><li> Autumn School in Computational Logic: September 12-14, 2025 </li><li> Doctoral Consortium: September 12-14, 2025 </li><li> Logic Programming Contest: September 16 or 17, 2025  </li><li> International Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming (PPDP 2025) </li><li> International Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and Transformation (LOPSTR 2025) </li></ul></li><li> SUBMISSION DETAILS<br/>  All submissions must be written in English. Papers accepted at ICLP may appear either in<br/><ul><li>   The journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP) published by Cambridge University Press. TPLP format is described at: <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming/information/author-instructions/preparing-your-materials">https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming/information/author-instructions/preparing-your-materials</a> </li><li>   The ICLP 2025 Technical Communication Proceedings published by Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS). EPTCS format is described at: <a href="http://style.eptcs.org">http://style.eptcs.org</a> </li></ul></li><li> Submissions may have one of two forms:<br/><ul><li> Technical Communication (TC) papers are at most 12 pages in EPTCS format, excluding references. Accepted TC papers will be published in the Technical Communication Proceedings. </li><li> Regular papers and IJCAI Fast Track papers are at most 14 pages in TPLP format, including references. Accepted regular and IJCAI Fast Track papers will be published in a special issue of TPLP. IJCAI Fast Track papers must be accompanied by a PDF cover letter detailing: </li><li> The improvements made to the paper compared to the previous (IJCAI’25) submission, including clarifications on any perceived errors in the reviewers' assessments, if applicable </li><li> The paper ID of the IJCAI’25 submission </li><li> The authors listed on the IJCAI’25 submission </li><li> The title of the IJCAI’25 submission </li><li> The original PDF submitted to IJCAI’25 </li><li> The IJCAI’25 reviews, including scores and text evaluations </li></ul>  The authors of IJCAI Fast Track papers must explicitly give consent for IJCAI’25 to share all submitted information with ICLP’25 to verify its accuracy. ICLP’25 may summarily reject papers for several reasons, including submissions that (a) are outside the thematic scope of ICLP, (b) inaccurately disclosed required information, or (c) omitted original authors without justification.  <br/>  Regular papers that are not (provisionally) accepted for TPLP may be invited to the Technical Communication Proceedings of ICLP’25. The authors can choose to convert a regular paper accepted for the Technical Communication Proceedings into an extended abstract (2 or 3 pages in EPTCS format), which should allow for submitting a long paper version elsewhere. <br/>  Submissions will be made via EasyChair, following the link <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iclp25">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iclp25</a><br/>  All papers must describe original, previously unpublished research, and must not simultaneously be submitted for publication elsewhere. These restrictions do not apply to Recently Published Research Track submissions as well as previously accepted workshop papers with a limited audience and/or without archival proceedings.<br/>  All accepted papers will be presented during the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be automatically included in the list of ALP members, who will receive quarterly updates from the Logic Programming Newsletter at no cost.<br/></li><li> VENUE <br/>  ICLP’25 will be held on the campus of the University of Calabria in Rende, Italy, during 12-19 September 2025.

For a full list of topics of interest please visit the website. <br/></li><li> Survey papers that present some aspects of the related topics from a new perspective and papers that describe experience with industrial applications and case studies are also welcome. <br/></li><li> PAPER SUBMISSION<br/>  Submissions can be made in two categories:<br/><ul><li> Regular Papers (15 pages max.) </li><li> Short Papers (8 pages max.) </li></ul>  References will NOT count towards the page limit. Additional pages may be used for appendices not intended for publication. Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be written in English.<br/></li><li> Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers/tools that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal, conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings. Submissions of Regular Papers must describe original work. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC Chairs in case of questions).<br/></li><li> Submissions of Short Papers may include presentations of exciting if not fully polished research or tool demonstrations that are of academic and industrial interest. Tool demonstrations should describe the relevant system, usability, and implementation aspects of a tool. All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume.<br/></li><li> After the symposium, a selection of a few best papers will be invited for submission to rapid publication in the Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). Authors of selected papers will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions to be considered for publication. The papers submitted to TPLP will be subject to the journal's standard reviewing process.<br/></li><li> SUBMISSION GUIDELINES<br/>   Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in English) in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science style. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title; authors and their affiliations; contact author's email; abstract; and three to four keywords which will be used to assist the PC in selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper. Authors should consult Springer's authors' instructions on the author's page, and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX (available also in Overleaf) or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, upon acceptance, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.<br/></li><li> Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their report. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use: \pagestyle{plain \usepackage{lineno} \linenumbers<br/></li><li> Papers should be submitted via EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2025">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2025</a><br/></li><li> PROGRAM CHAIRS<br/><ul><li> Santiago Escobar, Univesitat Politecnica de Valencia, Spain </li><li> Laura Titolo, Code Metal, USA </li></ul></li><li> PUBLICITY CHAIR<br/><ul><li> Manuel Borroto, University of Calabria, Italy </li></ul></li><li> HISTORY<br/>  LOPSTR is a renowned symposium that has been held for more than 30 years.

Over time, its aim has evolved and expanded; DL can be seen now as a general set of ideas and tools devised for representing, describing and reasoning about diverse kind of actions, including (but not limited to) frameworks tailored for specific programming problems/ paradigms (e.g., separation logics), settings for modelling new computing domains (e.g., probabilistic, continuous and quantum computation), frameworks for reasoning about information dynamics (e.g., dynamic epistemic logics) and systems for reasoning about long term information dynamics (e.g., learning theory).<br/></li><li> Both its theoretical relevance and practical potential make DLs a topic of interest in a number of scientific venues, from wide-scope software engineering conferences to modal logic specific events. The aim of the DaLí 2025 workshop is to bring together, in a single place, researchers with a shared interest in the formal study of actions (from Academia to Industry and more, from Mathematics to Computer Science and beyond) to present their work, foster discussions and encourage collaborations.<br/></li><li> Previous editions of DaLí took place in Brasília (2017), Porto (2019), online (2020, 2022) and Tblisi (2023).<br/></li><li> Submissions are invited on the general field of dynamic logic, its variants and applications.
