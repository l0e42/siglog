HIGHLIGHTS 2024: Highlights of Logic, Games and Automata
  Bordeaux, France, 16-20 September 2024 (in person when possible) 
  Joint with AUTOMATHA’24 and HCRW
CALL FOR PRESENTATIONS AND PARTICIPATION
* HIGHLIGHTS’24 and AUTOMATHA’24 are jointly scheduled from September 16 to September 20, 2024 at the University of Bordeaux, France, in LaBRI. They will be followed by the Highlights Collaborative Research Week (HCRW), from September 21 to 27, 2024.
* HIGHLIGHTS’24 is the twelfth in the series of international conferences “Highlights of Logic, Games and Automata”, aiming at integrating the community working in algorithmic model theory, automata theory, databases, games for logic and verification, logic and verification. Papers from these areas are dispersed across many conferences, which makes them difficult to follow. A visit to the HIGHLIGHTS conference should offer a wide picture of the latest research in the field and a chance to meet everybody in the community, not just those who happen to publish in one particular proceedings volume. There are no publications.
  AUTOMATHA’24 will be the second AutoMathA conference, after the one organised in 2015, which was itself the continuation of a European research project that terminated in 2010. The conference AutoMathA 2024 will survey a wide picture of research in automata theory and related mathematical fields. It will consist of invited lectures which describe significant progress over the past years, and will be a meeting point for both young and senior researchers to learn and to discuss automata theory, its connections with mathematics and its applications.
* HIGHLIGHTS’24 key features:
  HIGHLIGHTS is a conference without publications, where speakers give short presentations of their best work. It is colocated with AUTOMATHA’24, a conference featuring invited talks on mathematical aspects of automata theory. A chat of the conference is available during the event, and throughout the year. There is an early round of submissions and notifications to help with travel planning. The Highlights’ Collaborative Research Week (HCRW) offers means for research collaborations/discussions between participants. HCRW is scheduled after the conference. The Highlights Extended Stay Support Scheme (HESSS) helps participants find collaborators and organise visits in the vicinity of HIGHLIGHTS. Highlights has now an environmental chair, Antoine Amarilli, in charge of assessing the carbon footprint of the event. We encourage you to attend and present your best work - be it already published or not - at HIGHLIGHTS’24. 
* SCOPE
  Representative areas include, but are not restricted to:
  - Algebraic models of computation
  - Algorithmic model theory
  - Automata theory
  - Databases
  - Games for logic and verification
  - Logic
  - Verification

  HIGHLIGHTS’24 will be followed by the Highlights’ Collaborative Research Week (HCRW), from September 21 to 27 (including the weekend) at the University of Bordeaux. Participants to HCRW are free to organise any scientific activity they wish. It is up to you to decide what this week should be. Possibilities can be to meet someone in particular and work together, organise or attend a seminar/workshop/reading group, gather for solving open problems, solicit, offer and participate in a lecture. Working spaces will be provided on site for these activities to take place. We encourage participants to register and offer activities in advance.
  HCRW webpage: https://highlights-conference.org/2024/hcrw If you intend to participate to HCRW, post it on the zulip stream. To offer suggest or solicit activities: post your proposals on the dedicated zulip stream. HIGHLIGHTS EXTENDED STAY SUPPORT SCHEME (HESSS) The HESSS is an incentive for collaborations between participants of the conference and researchers working in research groups reachable by train from the conference location. The objective is to foster interactions with low carbon footprint. The mechanism is as follows:
  Research groups willing to participate in the scheme are/will be listed on the webpage: https://highlights-conference.org/2024/hcrw. These groups are offering to fund collaborations between HIGHLIGHTS participants and their members. The pair of a HIGHLIGHTS participant and a member of a listed research group submit a proposal, which takes the form of an email containing names, period of collaboration, and a sentence describing the planned activity. It has to be sent to the HESSS contact person of the research unit (better through zulip). The decision of acceptance is up to the research group. In particular, it may be subject to scientific scope, number of requests, or e.g., favouring distant participants. The only strict rule is that the visit should be around HIGHLIGHTS, and no airplane should be taken by the visitor to travel from HIGHLIGHTS to the visit location. Research groups interested in participating in the program should contact Thomas Colcombet (through Zulip).

PHD AND POSTDOC POSITIONS AT UNIVERSITY OF WARSAW
JOB ANNOUNCEMENT
*  The ERC Consolidator Grant BUKA (Limits of Structural Tractability) is offering 2 Postdoc and 2 PhD positions at the University of Warsaw. The goal of the project is to systematically explore the tractability limit of computational problems related to logic and structural graph theory. The project is led by Szymon Toruńczyk. The project website is https://sites.google.com/view/buka-project/ (see below for a description).
  We are looking for highly motivated and creative candidates. The applicants should have a strong background in at least one of the following fields: structural graph theory, algorithms and complexity, finite model theory, or model theory.
  The starting date of the grant is the 1st of October 2024, but applications will be considered until the positions are filled. For full consideration, we encourage applicants to express their interest by May 31st, 2024. 
  The duration of the PhD positions will be 4 years, and the duration of the Postdoc position will be up to 2 years. The positions come with a very good salary and carry no teaching load; however, if desired participation in teaching might be arranged. There is a generous travel budget.
* Description of BUKA 
  The area of the project lies at the interface of algorithmic and finite model theory, structural graph theory, and model theory. The goal is systematically explore fixed-parameter tractability of the model checking problem for first-order logic for restricted classes of graphs. 
  On the one hand, this topic is closely related to concepts studied in structural graph theory – such as classes of bounded treewidth, cliquewidth, twin-width, or nowhere dense classes – and in combinatorics – such as the Erdős-Hajnal property, χ-boundedness, VC-dimension, regularity. On the other hand, it is closely related to concepts studied in model theory – such as monadically stable and NIP theories – and in finite model theory – such as locality of first-order logic and query enumeration in database theory. Finally, it is closely related to parameterized complexity theory and algorithms.
  The project will develop the structure theory for the considered graphs or structures, and will seek efficient algorithms leveraging this structure.
  One of the main goals of the project is to characterize those hereditary graph classes, for which the model checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable. See https://sites.google.com/view/buka-project/ for more details.
