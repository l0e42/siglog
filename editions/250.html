LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the design and implementation of logic-based programming languages and database systems, and those working in knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR strives to encompass theoretical and experimental studies that have led or will lead to advances in declarative programming and knowledge representation, as well as their use in practical applications. LPNMR 2024 aims to bring together researchers from LPNMR core areas and application areas of the aforementioned kind in order to share research experiences, promote collaboration and identify directions for joint future research.<br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES<br/><table><tr><td>Paper registration: </td><td>Jun 21, 2024</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Submission deadline: </td><td>Jun 28, 2024</td> </tr><tr><td>Final notification: </td><td>Jul 28, 2024</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Final versions due: </td><td>Aug 15, 2024</td> </tr><tr><td>Conference: </td><td>Oct 11-14 2024</td> </tr></table></li><li> FAST JOURNAL TRACK FOR BEST PAPERS<br/></li><li> The two best papers focused on general AI topics will be invited for publication in either the Artificial Intelligence Journal or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, based on the preference of the authors.

Logic can be used, for instance, to express the agents' abilities, knowledge, and objectives. Strategic reasoning refers to algorithmic methods that allow for the development of good behavior for the agents of the system. At the intersection, we find logics that can express the existence of strategies or equilibria and can be used to reason about them. The LAMAS&SR workshop merges two international workshops: LAMAS (Logical Aspects of Multi-Agent Systems), which focuses on all kinds of logical aspects of multi-agent systems from the perspectives of artificial intelligence, computer science, and game theory, and SR (Strategic Reasoning), devoted to all aspects of strategic reasoning in formal methods and artificial intelligence. Over the years the communities and research themes of both workshops got closer and closer, with a significant overlap in the participants and organizers of both events. For this reason, the two events have been unified under the same flag, formally joining the two communities. As such, the LAMAS&SR workshop aims to bring together researchers working on different aspects of either logic or strategic reasoning in computer science, artificial intelligence, and multi-agent systems research, both from a theoretical and a practical viewpoint.<br/></li><li> TOPICS OF INTEREST<br/>  For a full list of the relevant topics visit the LAMAS24 website. <br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES<br/><table><tr><td>Paper submission deadline: </td><td>Jul 17, 2024</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Acceptance notification: </td><td>Aug 21, 2024</td> </tr><tr><td>Camera-ready version deadline: </td><td>Sep 07, 2024</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>LAMAS&SR 2024 workshop: </td><td>Nov 2nd, 3rd, or 4ths 2024</td> </tr></table></li><li> SUBMISSION.<br/>  Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of up to 4 pages plus 1 page for references only, in the format of the KR 2024 conference (KR24_authors_kit.zip).

Additionally, this conference seeks to facilitate the transfer of experience, adaptation of methods, and where possible, foster collaboration among different groups. The topics of interest cover all aspects of formal methods, especially those related to advancing the application of formal methods in the software industry and promoting their integration with practical engineering techniques. Following the success of the previous FSEN editions, the next edition of the FSEN conference will take place in Västerås, Sweden, April 7-8, 2025.<br/></li><li> IMPORTANT DATES <br/><table><tr><td>Abstract Submission: </td><td>October 7, 2024 (AoE)</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Paper Submission: </td><td>October 14, 2024 (AoE)</td> </tr><tr><td>Notification: </td><td>Dec 02, 2024</td> </tr><tr class="odd"><td>Final Camera-ready Submission: </td><td>January 13, 2025 (AoE)</td> </tr><tr><td>Conference: </td><td>Apr 7-8 2025</td> </tr></table></li><li> KEYNOTE SPEAKERS <br/><ul><li> Işıl Dillig, University of Texas at Austin </li><li> Alexander Serebrenik, Eindhoven University of Technology </li><li> Marielle Stoelinga, University of Twente and Radboud University, Nijmegen </li></ul></li><li> PAPER SUBMISSION<br/>  Authors are invited to submit full papers (up to 15 pages including references) describing original research, applications and tools; or short papers (up to 6 pages including references) describing ongoing research or new ideas that have not yet been fully validated. Both categories of papers must be submitted electronically in PDF using the online submission process via the Easychair conference system at the following link: <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fsen2025">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fsen2025</a>. Contributions must be written in English, should be formatted according to the Springer LNCS style (LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates) that can be found at the following link (<a href="http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">http://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>) and not exceed the page limit for the category (including figures and references). Each submission will be thoroughly reviewed by at least three reviewers considering scientific originality, significance, relevance to the FSEN conference, technical soundness, clarity, self-containedness and discussion of appropriate related work. The reviewers will be asked to rate the submissions and evaluate whether they can be accepted as:<br/><ul><li> Full paper for the LNCS proceedings </li><li> Short paper for the LNCS proceedings </li><li> Poster (not included in the proceedings) </li></ul></li><li> Papers accepted in the first 2 categories will be invited for presentation at the conference. Posters will be illustrated by the authors in separate poster sessions. Submissions are required to report on original, unpublished work and should not be submitted simultaneously for publication elsewhere (cf. IFIP's Author Code of Conduct, see <a href="http://www.ifip.org/">http://www.ifip.org/</a> under Publications/Links).<br/></li><li> PROCEEDINGS AND SPECIAL ISSUE <br/>  The post-proceedings of FSEN'25 will be published by Springer in the LNCS series. Following the tradition of FSEN, we plan to have a special issue of the Science of Computer Programming journal devoted to FSEN'25. After the conference a selection of papers will be invited for this special issue. The invited papers should be revised and extended and will undergo a new round of review by an international program committee.

The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and techniques that are needed for their implementation. Along with the main conference, CAV will feature nine workshops (in addition to the Verification Mentoring Workshop).
