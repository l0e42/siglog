DaLi 2025: 6th Workshop on Dynamic Logic - New trends and applications
  Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, P. R. China
  October 20-21, 2025
  http://dali2025.web.ua.pt (temporary link)  
CALL FOR PAPERS
* IMPORTANT DATES
-dh Abstract submission deadline:  1st June, 2025
-dh Full paper submission deadline:  5th of June, 2025
-d Author notifications: 15th of July, 2025
*  OVERVIEW
  Building on the ideas of Floyd-Hoare logic, dynamic logic was introduced in the 70's as a formal tool for reasoning about, and verify, classic imperative programs. Over time, its aim has evolved and expanded; DL can be seen now as a general set of ideas and tools devised for representing, describing and reasoning about diverse kind of actions, including (but not limited to) frameworks tailored for specific programming problems/ paradigms (e.g., separation logics), settings for modelling new computing domains (e.g., probabilistic, continuous and quantum computation), frameworks for reasoning about information dynamics (e.g., dynamic epistemic logics) and systems for reasoning about long term information dynamics (e.g., learning theory).
* Both its theoretical relevance and practical potential make DLs a topic of interest in a number of scientific venues, from wide-scope software engineering conferences to modal logic specific events. The aim of the DaLí 2025 workshop is to bring together, in a single place, researchers with a shared interest in the formal study of actions (from Academia to Industry and more, from Mathematics to Computer Science and beyond) to present their work, foster discussions and encourage collaborations.
* Previous editions of DaLí took place in Brasília (2017), Porto (2019), online (2020, 2022) and Tblisi (2023).
* Submissions are invited on the general field of dynamic logic, its variants and applications. A more detailed topic description will be found in the webpage. 
* SUBMISSIONS AND PROCEEDINGS
  We solicit two categories of papers:
 - Regular papers - describing original research results, case studies, or surveys, should not exceed 15 pages (excluding bibliography of at most two pages).
 - Short papers - describing original research results or case studies, maybe in an incubation phase, with 6 to 8 pages (excluding bibliography of at most one page).
  Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS papers. All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. Papers can be submitted through Easychair: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dal2025 A post-proceedings volume in Springer LNCS is being arranged. A special issue of the event with extended papers will be published in Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming (Elsevier).
