* ABOUT 
  We invite submissions to the 8th iteration of the Games, Agents and Incentives Workshop, co-located with AAMAS 2026 in Paphos, Cyprus, https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/. Games, Agents and Incentives is a confederated workshop which focuses on agents and incentives in AI.  In particular, it promotes approaches that deal with game theory (cooperative and non-cooperative), social choice, and agent-mediated e-commerce aspects of AI systems. The confederated workshop merges multiple workshops that have been associated with AAMAS in the past, which considered different aspects of the general interplay between AI and economics including CoopMAS, AMEC, and EXPLORE.
  Over the past two decades, the focus of agent incentives in decentralised and centralised AI systems has increased dramatically. These issues come up when designing preference aggregation mechanisms and markets; computing equilibria and bidding strategies; facilitating cooperation among agents; and fairly dividing resources.
* SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 
  Authors should submit full papers electronically in PDF format at: https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2026/Workshop/GAIW Formatting Guidelines: Please format papers according to the AAMAS 2026 format (https://cyprusconferences.org/aamas2026/submission-instructions/). Paper Length: Papers can be at most 8 pages long in AAMAS format. Additional pages may be used for references. Supplemental material can be appended at the end of the paper. However, reviewers are instructed to make their evaluations based on the main submission, and are not obligated to consult the supplemental material.
  Multiple Submissions: To widen participation and encourage discussion, there will be no formal publication of workshop proceedings. We will, however, post the accepted papers online to the benefit of the participants to the workshop. Therefore, submission of preliminary work and papers to be submitted or in preparation for submission to other major venues in the field are encouraged.
  Past Submissions: In order to strike a balance between new work and work that may have been presented, but not widely seen, we ask that if authors want to submit published work they do so non-anonymously and clearly indicate when and where the work was published. We will only accept work which has been published in the last calendar year (e.g., IJCAI 2025, NeurIPS 2025, AAAI 2025, AAAI 2026 and any conference held strictly after Jan 1, 2025).
  We invite papers on topics of game theory, mechanism design, fair allocation, computational social choice, and their applications to multi-agent systems. 
* Best Presentation Award: The organizing committee of GAIW will be giving two awards (first-place and runner up) for best paper presentations. The award criteria include the clarity of presentation, the level of engagement, the content, and discussion handling.
  Inquiries: If you have any questions, direct them to alan.tsang@carleton.ca.

C.A.R.L.A. 2026: 2nd Workshop on Cognitive Architectures for Robotics: LLMs and Logic in Action
  Lisbon, Portugal
  July 18, 2026
  https://ws-carla.github.io/web/
  Part of FLoC 2026, https://www.floc26.org/
CALL FOR PAPERS
* IMPORTANT DATES 
  All dates are AoE 
 -dh Paper registration: 2 May
 -dh Paper submission deadline: 8 May
 -d Paper notification: 22 May
 -d Camera-Ready deadline: 19 June
  Accepted papers will be presented as posters, with a subset selected for oral presentations. The workshop will take place in person at FLoC 2026, with virtual participation options not guaranteed at the moment.
* GENERAL INFORMATION
  The Workshop on Cognitive Architectures for Robotics: LLMs and Logic in Action (CARLA) seeks to transform the landscape of intelligent behaviors by pioneering the integration of large language models (LLMs), symbolic reasoning, and logic solvers into autonomous systems. As robotics advances toward real-world applications requiring adaptability, safety, and complex decision-making, this workshop focuses on harnessing the synergy between data-driven learning models and symbolic, logic-based systems to advance automation. This year, the workshop further expands its scope to explicitly include simulated environments as first-class experimental and methodological tools. In particular, CARLA emphasizes the use of videogames and digital twins as scalable, controllable, and safe testbeds for cognitive robotics research. These environments enable systematic investigation of embodied reasoning, LLM-driven planning, and logic-based decision-making under diverse and dynamic conditions that would be difficult or costly to reproduce in physical settings. By bridging cognitive architectures with the structured management of virtual applications, CARLA aims to foster principled approaches to transferring knowledge and behaviors learned in simulation to real-world systems, while supporting reproducibility and benchmarking across research efforts.
* SCOPE AND SUBMISSIONS
  For a detailed description of topics of interest and submission guidelines please visit the website. Submissions will be managed via the FLoC submission system. Papers will remain private during the review process. All authors must maintain up-to-date profiles to ensure proper conflict-of-interest management and paper matching. Incomplete profiles may result in desk rejection.  Submit papers through the dedicated C.A.R.L.A. submission system: https://submissions.floc26.org/carla/ 
  The workshop follows a single-blind review process. Submissions must not be anonymized by removing author names, affiliations, and acknowledgments.
