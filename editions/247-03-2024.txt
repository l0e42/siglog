CLIRAI 2024: Computational Linguistics, Information, Reasoning, and AI
  Special Session: Computational Linguistics, Information, Reasoning, and AI (CLIRAI) (previously: CompLingInfoReasAI) 
  At 21st International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial  Intelligence (DCAI) 2024 University of Salamanca (Spain) 26th-28th June, 2024
  https://www.dcai-conference.net/tracks/special-sessions/clirai
CALL FOR PAPERS
* SCOPE
  Computational and technological developments that incorporate natural language and reasoning methods are proliferating. Adequate coverage encounters difficult problems related to the phenomena of partiality, underspecification, perspectives of agents, and context dependency. These phenomena are signature features of information in nature, natural languages, and reasoning. The session covers theoretical work, applications, approaches, and techniques for computational models of information, language (artificial, human, or natural in other ways), reasoning. The goal is to promote computational systems and related models of language, thought, reasoning, and other related processes.

WADT 2024 - 27th International Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques
  Enschede, the Netherlands
  https://conf.researchr.org/home/wadt-2024
  Part of the STAF 2024 multi-conference
  Mon 8 – Fri 12 July 2024
CALL FOR PAPERS
* AIMS AND SCOPE
  The algebraic approach to system specification encompasses many aspects of the formal design of software systems. Originally born as a formal method for reasoning about abstract data types, it now covers new specification frameworks and programming paradigms (such as object-oriented, aspect-oriented, agent-oriented, logic and higher-order functional programming) as well as a wide range of application areas (including information systems, concurrent, distributed and mobile systems). The workshop will provide an opportunity to present recent and ongoing work, to meet colleagues, and to discuss new ideas and future trends.
* TOPICS OF INTEREST 
  Typical, but not exclusive topics of interest are: 
  - Foundations of algebraic specification 
  - Other approaches to formal specification, including process calculi and models of concurrent, distributed, and cyber-physical systems
  - Specification languages, methods, and environments
  - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques
  - Model-driven development
  - Graph transformations, term rewriting, and proof systems
  - Integration of formal specification techniques
  - Theorem-proving technologies and integration with specification languages
  - Formal testing and quality assurance, validation, and verification
  - Algebraic approaches to knowledge representation and cognitive sciences
* WORKSHOP FORMAT AND LOCATION
  The workshop will be part of the STAF 2024 multi-conference at Twente, the Netherlands. Presentations will be selected on the basis of submitted abstracts.
* IMPORTANT DATES
  -dh Abstract submission: 15 Apr 2024 
  -d Abstract notification: 29 Apr 2024 
  -dh Full-paper submission: 16 Sep 2024
  -d Full-paper notification: 25 Nov 2024
* SUBMISSIONS 
  The scientific programme of the workshop will include presentations of recent results or ongoing research as well as invited talks. The presentations will be selected by the Programme Committee on the basis of submitted abstracts according to originality, significance and general interest. Abstracts must not exceed two pages, including references, in LNCS format. If a longer version of the contribution is available, it can be made accessible on the web and referenced in the abstract.
  The abstracts will have to be submitted electronically via EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=staf2024.
* PROCEEDINGS
  After the workshop, authors will be invited to submit full papers for the refereed proceedings. All submissions will be reviewed by the Programme Committee. The selection of papers will be based on originality, soundness, and significance of the presented ideas and results. The post-proceedings will then be published by Springer as a volume of Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
* SPONSORSHIP 
  The workshop takes place under the auspices of IFIP WG 1.3.

THIRTEENTH SUMMER SCHOOL ON FORMAL TECHNIQUES 2024 
  Menlo College, Atherton, California
  May 25 - June 3, 2024 
  http://fm.csl.sri.com/SSFT24
CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
* Techniques based on formal logic, such as model checking, satisfiability, static analysis, and automated theorem proving, are finding a broad range of applications in modeling, analysis, verification, and synthesis. This school, the thirteenth in the series, focuses on the principles and practice of formal techniques, with a strong emphasis on the hands-on use and development of this technology. It primarily targets graduate students and young researchers who are interested in studying and using formal techniques in their research. A prior background in formal methods is helpful but not required. Participants at the school can expect to have a seriously fun time experimenting with the tools and techniques presented in the lectures during the laboratory sessions. The main lectures run from Monday May 27 to Fri May 31. They are preceded by a background course "Speaking Logic" taught by Natarajan Shankar and Stephane Graham-Lengrand (SRI CSL) on May 25/26. The summer school is immediately followed by a two-day Bootcamp to reinforce some of the skills acquired during the school. Participants in the Bootcamp work with formal tools and techniques (including those taught in this and prior summer school editions) under the supervision of the Bootcamp faculty to create verified artifacts.
* The lecturers at the school include: Josef Urban (CIIRC): Combining Machine Learning and Theorem Proving; Marsha Chechik (U. Toronto): Elicitation and Formal Reasoning about Normative Requirements; Leonardo de Moura and David Thrane Christiansen: The Lean 4 programming language and theorem prover; Cesare Tinelli (U. Iowa): Modeling and analyzing reactive systems with logic-based symbolic model checkers; Armando Solar-Lezama (MIT): Neurosymbolic Programming for better learning. The program also includes invited talks from distinguished speakers (to be announced).
* This year, the school/bootcamp will take place in a hybrid mode: the lectures and labs will be live-streamed and recorded. We strongly encourage in-person participation so that you can benefit from interactions outside the classroom. We have funding from NSF to cover transportation/food/lodging expenses for selected US-based students. Non-student and non-US in-person participants are expected to cover their own transportation and will be charged a fee (around $150/day) to cover the cost of food and lodging.
* The registration link is at the URL: http://fm.csl.sri.com/SSFT24. Applications should be submitted together with names of two references (preferably advisors, professors, or senior colleagues). Applicants are urged to submit their applications as early as possible (no later than April 30, 2024), since there are only a limited number of spaces available. Those needing invitation letters for visa purposes are encouraged to complete their applications as early as possible. We strongly encourage the participation of women and under-represented minorities in the summer school.
